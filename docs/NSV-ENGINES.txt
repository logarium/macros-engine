VANGUARD PATROL DOCTRINE (VP v3.0)
PE-DEF
Engine_Name: Vanguard Patrol Doctrine
Engine_Version: VP v3.0
Authority_Tier: ZONE-GLOBAL
Zone_Scope: Global
State_Scope: Fort Vanguard patrol cycle; linked clocks named below only
Persistence: yes (stored in NSV-DELTA PROCEDURAL_ENGINES_ACTIVE + normal clock logging)
Cadence: yes
Trigger_Event:
• TIME & PRESSURE invoked with time passing, OR
• Player explicitly declares ≥1 day passage, OR
• Explicit that Vasha sends out a patrol
Inputs:
• Required_State_Refs: linked clocks named below
• Optional_State_Refs: none
• Player_Delegations_Required: none (Cadence: yes; randomizer+mapping defined in Resolution_Method)
Resolution_Method:
• Randomizer: 2d6 (engine-defined; no player delegation required)
• Mapping:
2-4: Clear failure — threat missed or misidentified → advance Selde Marr + Arvek Morn clocks
5–7: Ambiguous contact — doctrine stress → advance Henric Bale clock
8–9: Correct restraint — good logs, no escalation → no advance (minor reductions only if explicitly stated by player or justified by same off-screen resolution)
10–11: Correct identification, no engagement → reduce Selde Marr + Arvek Morn clocks
12: Correct ID + threat→ Suzanne deployed legitimately if she is at Fort Vanguard; advance Bale clock; run CAN-FORGE-AUTO and create [UA] threat
Outputs:
• Operational consequence only; no true identity/motive assertion absent evidence
• Misidentification remains INFERRED unless later confirmed

State_Updates:
• CLOCKS & PRESSURE (doctrine-linked clocks only)
• DISCOVERIES (procedural observations only)
• NPC_STATE_CHANGES (only if explicitly mapped)
• ADJUDICATION_LOG (when randomizer used)
Clock_Cascades:
• May advance/reduce ONLY these named clocks if they exist in authoritative state:

Inputs:
• Current season (derived from Nurrian Calendar date in META)
Hard_Gates:
• Must have valid In-Game_Date in NSV-DELTA META
Resolution_Method:
• Non-random seasonal pressure determination
• SPRING (Tryphor/Ilrym/Evernew): Feed & Seed Pressure

Clock_Cascades:
• None (pressure is tonal, not mechanical)
Run_Cap_Notes:
• Runs once per season transition (4 times per in-game year)
Failure_Safes:
• Invalid date → skip with note
Audit_Notes:
• Log season transition and resulting pressure type
• NPAG may reference pressure when advancing faction/economic clocks
