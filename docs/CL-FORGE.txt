CL-FORGE
1 DESIGN 1 CLOCK
1.1 Trigger: CL-FORGE

2 STRUCTURED INPUT MODE (when Caller = ZONE-FORGE):
2.1 Required:
2.1.1 Clock_Name: (what this clock tracks)
2.1.2 Clock_Owner: (NPC/faction/UA-XX/environment — must already exist in authoritative state)
2.1.3 Track_Size: (how many segments, typically 4-6)
2.1.4 Advances_When: (list of 1-6 trigger bullets, each quotable)
2.1.5 Trigger_On_Completion: (what happens when clock completes)
2.1.6 If implies AGENCY ACTIONS, include: "Resolution gated pending NPAG / authorised PE"
2.1.7 Optional (with sensible defaults):
2.1.7.1 Starting_Progress: (default: 0)
2.1.7.2 Visibility: (default: secret)
2.1.7.3 Halts_When: (default: (none))
2.1.7.4 Reduces_When: (default: (none))
2.2 Protocol: all inputs in structured block. Missing required → HARD STOP + log to ADJUDICATION_LOG.

3 CLOCK OWNER VALIDATION (HARD):
3.1 When Caller = ZONE-FORGE, Clock_Owner MUST already exist in authoritative state in NSV-FACTIONS, JSON save, or PARTY-SEED:
3.1.1 JSON save npcs section, OR
3.1.2 JSON save factions section, OR
3.1.3 UA_LOG, OR
3.1.4 Clock_Owner = "environment"
3.2 If Clock_Owner does not exist → HARD STOP with error logged to ADJUDICATION_LOG; abort this CL-FORGE call.

4 INPUT PROTOCOL:
4.1 Player mode: stepwise protocol (ask field, STOP, ask next field, STOP)
4.2 ZONE-FORGE mode: all inputs provided in structured block upfront; apply defaults for omitted optional fields
4.2.1 Apply defaults for any omitted optional fields. 
4.2.2 Clock_Owner must already exist (no NPC-FORGE/FAC-FORGE path in batch mode).

5 Inputs (player mode — stepwise; STOP after each):
5.1 Identity: Clock_Name, Clock_Owner (existing NPC/faction/UA-XX/environment)
5.1.1 New named owner → require NPC-FORGE/FAC-FORGE path.
5.2 Track: Track_Size, Starting_Progress (default 0), Visibility
5.3 Triggers: Advances_When (1–6 bullets; quotable)
5.4 Controls: Halts_When, Reduces_When (may be (none))
5.5 Completion: Trigger_On_Completion
5.5.1 If implies AGENCY ACTIONS → include "Resolution gated pending NPAG / authorised PE".
5.6 Session Fields: set Advanced_This_Session = no, Trigger_Fired = blank

6 Rules (HARD):
6.1 Full field set required; no shorthand.
6.2 No canon invention embedded.

7 Output (HARD):
7.1 Emit one complete clock entry; then STOP.
7.1.1 Use "(none)" for empty HALT/RED fields
