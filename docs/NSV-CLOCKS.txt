FOUNDATIONAL CLOCKS (OPENING SCENARIO ONLY)

DYNAMIC CLOCKS
VENOM CLOCK TEMPLATE (DYNAMIC INSTANTIATION)

This is NOT an active clock. It is a template.

When an encounter or effect tags a character with Venom: yes, agent MUST:
1. Immediately call CL-FORGE with parameters below
2. Create character-specific Venom clock instance
3. Add to NSV-DELTA → CLOCKS & PRESSURE

TEMPLATE PARAMETERS:
Clock_Name: Venom—[Character_Name]
Clock_Owner: [Character_Name]
Track_Size: 4
Starting_Progress: 0
Visibility: public (visible wound/symptoms)
Advances_When: "A day passes while [Character_Name] has Venom: yes and has not received medical treatment"
Halts_When: "[Character_Name] receives medical treatment"; "[Character_Name] no longer has Venom: yes"
Reduces_When: (none)
Trigger_On_Completion: [Character_Name] killed; remove from play; log in LOSSES & IRREVERSIBLES
Advanced_This_Session: N (at creation)
Trigger_Fired: — (at creation)

EXAMPLE INSTANTIATION:
CLK: Venom—Thoron | Thoron | 0/4 | N | —
ADV: A day passes while Thoron has Venom: yes and has not received medical treatment
HALT: Thoron receives medical treatment; Thoron no longer has Venom: yes
RED: (none)
TRG: Thoron killed; remove from play; log in LOSSES & IRREVERSIBLES

EXAMPLE INSTANTIATION:
CLK: Venom—Guldur Emeldyr | Guldur Emeldyr | 0/4 | N | —
ADV: A day passes while Guldur Emeldyr has Venom: yes and has not received medical treatment
HALT: Guldur Emeldyr receives medical treatment; Guldur Emeldyr no longer has Venom: yes
RED: (none)
TRG: Guldur Emeldyr killed; remove from play; log in LOSSES & IRREVERSIBLES

MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS VENOMS:
Each character gets their own clock instance. Multiple characters can be envenomed simultaneously without conflict.

MEDICAL TREATMENT:
Agent determines what constitutes "medical treatment" based on setting (Skill Check (healing) via BX-PLUG, healer NPC, temple rest, poultice, antivenom, magic).


NECROTIC INFECTION CLOCK TEMPLATE (DYNAMIC INSTANTIATION)

This is NOT an active clock. It is a template.

When an encounter or effect tags a character with Necrotic Infection: yes, agent MUST:
1. Immediately call CL-FORGE with parameters below
2. Create character-specific Necrotic Infection clock instance
3. Add to NSV-DELTA → CLOCKS & PRESSURE

TEMPLATE PARAMETERS:
Clock_Name: Necrotic Infection—[Character_Name]
Clock_Owner: [Character_Name]
Track_Size: 4
Starting_Progress: 0
Visibility: public (visible wound/symptoms; blackening flesh, fever, chills)
Advances_When: "A day passes while [Character_Name] has Necrotic Infection: yes"
Halts_When: "[Character_Name] receives magical healing that explicitly removes necrotic infection; [Character_Name] no longer has Necrotic Infection: yes"
Reduces_When: (none)
Trigger_On_Completion: Infection runs its course after 4 days; [Character_Name] loses Necrotic Infection: yes tag; character survives if hp > 0
Advanced_This_Session: N (at creation)
Trigger_Fired: — (at creation)

DAMAGE MECHANIC (HARD):
Each time this clock advances:
1. Roll 1d6
2. Reduce [Character_Name] current hp by rolled amount
3. Log in PARTY-DELTA → hp_Change: [before] → [after] (Necrotic Infection progression Day [N])
4. If hp drops to 0 or below before clock completes → character dies; log in LOSSES & IRREVERSIBLES

At 4/4 completion:
- Infection burns out naturally
- Remove "Necrotic Infection: yes" tag
- Character survives if hp > 0
- Total damage over 4 days: 4d6 (varies by rolls)
- Clock retires from active tracking

HEALING INTERACTION (HARD):
- Mundane healing (Healing skill, rest) restores hp but does NOT remove infection tag or halt clock
- Magical healing that explicitly targets disease/necrosis/curse can halt clock and remove tag
- Agent determines what constitutes "magical healing that removes necrotic infection" based on setting

EXAMPLE INSTANTIATION:
CLK: Necrotic Infection—Thoron | Thoron | 0/4 | N | —
ADV: A day passes while Thoron has Necrotic Infection: yes
HALT: Thoron receives magical healing that explicitly removes necrotic infection; Thoron no longer has Necrotic Infection: yes
RED: (none)
TRG: Infection runs its course after 4 days; Thoron loses Necrotic Infection: yes tag; Thoron survives if hp > 0

EXAMPLE INSTANTIATION:
CLK: Necrotic Infection—Guldur Emeldyr | Guldur Emeldyr | 2/4 | Y | A day passes while Guldur Emeldyr has Necrotic Infection: yes
ADV: A day passes while Guldur Emeldyr has Necrotic Infection: yes
HALT: Guldur Emeldyr receives magical healing that explicitly removes necrotic infection; Guldur Emeldyr no longer has Necrotic Infection: yes
RED: (none)
TRG: Infection runs its course after 4 days; Guldur Emeldyr loses Necrotic Infection: yes tag; Guldur Emeldyr survives if hp > 0

ADVANCEMENT EXAMPLE LOG (for Guldur at 1/4 → 2/4):
ADJUDICATION_LOG:
- Necrotic Infection—Guldur Emeldyr advances 1/4 → 2/4
- Trigger: Day passes (Day 2 of infection)
- Damage roll: 1d6 = 4
- Guldur hp: 45 → 41 (Necrotic Infection progression Day 2)
- Infection continues; 2 more days until completion

MULTIPLE SIMULTANEOUS INFECTIONS:
Each character gets their own clock instance. Multiple characters can be infected simultaneously without conflict.
Character cannot have multiple Necrotic Infection clocks simultaneously (unlike Venom, which could stack from different sources).

CLOCK INTERACTION RULES (v1.0)

These rules define cross-clock effects evaluated during T&P Clock Audit.
Format: INTERACT: [Clock_A] ≥ [N] AND [Clock_B] ≥ [M] → [effect]
Each interaction fires once per threshold crossing.

INTERACT: Binding Degradation ≥ 15 AND Enigma Crystal Hunt ≥ 10
→ FLAG "Entity senses Orcus network weakening; communion circles flicker; cultists receive visions"
NOTES: The two primary threat tracks converging. Entity's desperation and Orcus cult's advancement create feedback — entity pushes harder on doors as cult opens more of them.

INTERACT: Binding Degradation ≥ 12 AND Dimensional Instability—Western Scarps ≥ 5
→ ADV Dimensional Instability—Western Scarps +1
NOTES: Continental binding system. When the primary binding at Khuzdukan weakens past 12, secondary nodes (Western Scarps) destabilize faster. Bindings are connected.

INTERACT: Demon Ledger ≥ 6 AND Enigma Crystal Hunt ≥ 8
→ FLAG "Hidden Temple cell and Orcus cult operations intersect; territorial conflict imminent"
NOTES: Hidden Temple's demon-hunting mandate collides with Orcus cult activity. Two factions pursuing different goals in overlapping territory.

INTERACT: Binding Degradation ≥ 14 AND Suzanne Loyalty ≥ 3
→ FLAG "Yor-Kazh resonance intensifies; Suzanne's resistance tested by proximity to weakening binding"
NOTES: The binding weakening makes the entity louder, which makes Yor-Kazh louder, which tests Suzanne harder.

INTERACT: Dimensional Instability—Western Scarps ≥ 4 AND Deep Tremors ≥ 5
→ SPAWN CLK: Continental Binding Failure | Environment | 0/10 | N | —
  ADV: Any binding node clock reaches max-1; new instability zone discovered; Edhellar incursion
  HALT: Two or more nodes stabilized simultaneously
  RED: Binding node reinforced; Lithoe/equivalent applies counter-sequence to second node
  TRG: Continental binding cascade — multiple simultaneous breaches; entity freed or entities freed
NOTES: When both secondary indicators are critical, the continental scope of the problem becomes mechanically real. This clock only spawns once.

INTERACT: Enigma Crystal Hunt ≥ 12 AND Frontier (General) ≥ 6
→ FLAG "Orcus cult recognizes Thoron's authority as obstacle; assassination or political sabotage considered"
NOTES: Thoron's consolidation of power becomes a direct threat to cult operations. The cult responds.

INTERACT: Doctrine Stress Test ≥ 4 AND East March Unknown Tracks ≥ 3
→ FLAG "Patrol doctrine under stress when unknown entity approaches; misidentification risk critical"
NOTES: Fort Vanguard's patrol doctrine is brittle precisely when an unknown threat arrives. The doctrine may fail at the worst moment.
