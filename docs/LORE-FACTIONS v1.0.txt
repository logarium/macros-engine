FOUNDATIONAL FACTIONS (from NSV-FACTIONS)
BLACKTOOTH ORCS
Type: They are very traditional and all they want is to be left alone in their forest to be at peace and hunt and sing and drum and eat the special mushroom and commune with the ancestors and dance the dance of their people. Although their initial contact was hostile, Lithoe's fireball impressed them and they struck an alliance with the Gammarians. They trade. They send gifts. They welcome respectful visitors. If you cross them, they will wear your face as a trophy. Just saying.
History: Have been here for over 6000 years, live completely at one with their forest.
Territory: Blacktooth Forest (6000+ years of occupation).
Current state (NSV-DELTA): Active. No offscreen actions resolved. Status unknown.
Relationships: Despise Hill Scavengers who strip Khuzduk ruins. Remember the Khuzduk dwarves when nobody else does.

BLOODSWAMP HOBGOBLINS
Type: Local, entrenched. Quiet, stealthy hunters, rangers, trackers. Nomads settled in swamps generations ago.
History: Helped Gammaria in early years. Careful isolation in Sighing Swamps depths. Uneasy co-existence.
Territory: Deep Swamps / Sighing Swamps.
Current state: Active. No offscreen actions resolved. Status unknown.

CHILDREN OF THE DEAD GODS
Type: Ancient, clandestine. Ordered diabolists. Servants of the bound Dead Gods of Krovekëa.They hide within all manner of organisations, communicating covertly through trained carrier pigeons.
History: Present since pre-Gammarian ages - small cults drawn to the wilderness by the lore of the Dead Gods. Work with precision and secrecy to weaken ancient bindings. Seek the release of the Dead Gods — the most primordial and catastrophic threat on Erroth.
Canonical truth (restricted): Krovekëa was dark sister-world, destroyed by Enigma Crystal; Dead Gods are final survivors.
Current state: Active. No offscreen actions resolved. Status unknown.

CHURCH OF HAADIS
Type: Global, entrenched. Malevolent, patient, doctrinally absolute. Ancient religion elevated to transnational church. Ruled by Jezrath Hallowsbane in Ellethea - High Reavers have regional control.
History: Transnational legitimacy-competitor. Unofficially invested in Gammaria through Father Lalholm. Tests moral/jurisdictional boundaries. Officially neutral; slow infiltration; long-horizon pressure. The Church's true concerns are theological - send souls to Haadis by whatever means possible.
Canonical truth (restricted): Haadis desires to devour souls sent by his Reavers.
Current state: Active. Testing boundaries. Lalholm's departure from Riverwatch may delay or accelerate jurisdictional push.
Key NPC: Father Lalholm (companion, with Thoron). The Church's investment is through him whether he likes it or not.

CORRUPTED EDHELLAR
Type: Degenerate remnants of Edhellar, warped by the diabolical energies of the Dead Gods of Krovekëa. Refugees from Galhennoi, they had been trying to reach Ard Minya after the Bright Conflict but were waylaid on the eastern side of the Vallandor Mountains. Now they are creatures of titanic horror and alien stature. They are mad and evil and warp time and space by their mere presence. A single Edhellar could lay waste to half of Gammaria - and no one knows what they want.
History: Destroyers of earlier cultures (exterminated People of the Henge ~1500 AS). Corrupted by Krovekëan seepage ~1100 AS. Scattered, monstrous. Active existential threat.
Current state: Active, hostile. Confirmed in both Eastern and Western Scarps. Wyvern matriarch killed. Ridgeline sighting (Old Maren: "they only kill if you run"). Dimensional instability worsening.
Canon: Humanity is descended from the remnants of the Kal Therryn (restricted to Corrupted Edhellar knowledge only).

History: Embedded since founding era. Corrupts existing institutions from within. Predatory outsider; tolerated nowhere, rooted in Seawatch ossuaries.
Canonical truth (restricted): Orcus seeks the Enigma Moon.
Current state: Active. No offscreen actions resolved. Status unknown.
Key NPC: Suzanne of Corlaine (companion, with Thoron). Suzanne serves Orcus not by choice but because the alternative is the annihilation of her soul. Yor-Kazh the Unholy Reaver feeds on death.

FREE HOPE MERCHANTS
Type: Small mercantile league. Idealistic, reformist traders. Anti-Golden Hind reaction.
History: Formed to resist exploitative bulk trade. Ideological enemies of Golden Hind. Favoured by Gammaria but structurally weak.

HIDDEN TEMPLE
Type: Transcontinental clandestine order. The Hidden Temple is based in Ellethea, in the Reiget Cities, where it combines the temples of Thule and Demetrion (see LORE-WORLD for details) - deceit and justice. The Hidden Temple comprises shadow-clerics, sacred assassins, demon-hunters, and contracts-for-hire. They are particularly focused on rooting out the activity of the Cult of Orcus.
