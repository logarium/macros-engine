PE-FORGE
DESIGN 1 PERSISTENT PROCEDURAL ENGINE
Trigger: PE-FORGE | DESIGN PE | CREATE PE | Caller = ZONE-FORGE

STRUCTURED INPUT MODE (when Caller = ZONE-FORGE):
Required:
  • Engine_Name: (what this PE does)
  • Zone_Scope: (where it operates)
  • Trigger_Event: (when it fires, 1-3 phrases)
Optional (with defaults):
  • Authority_Tier: (default: ZONE-LOCAL)
  • Cadence: (default: no)
  • Resolution_Method: (default: agent designs from canon)
  • Persistence: (default: yes)
Protocol: all inputs in structured block. Agent designs remaining fields from canon + Zone_Scope characteristics.

INPUT PROTOCOL:
  • Player mode: stepwise protocol (ask field, STOP, ask next field, STOP)
  • ZONE-FORGE mode: all inputs in structured block; agent completes PE-DEF
Required Fields (collect across steps):
•	Identity: Engine_Name, Engine_Version, Authority_Tier, Registry_Target (CSEM|SSM_1A|NSV_DELTA_REGISTRY)
•	Scope: Zone_Scope, State_Scope
•	Persistence: Persistence (yes/no), Cadence (yes/no), Cadence_Priority (int; default 0 if cadence=yes)
•	Activation: Trigger_Event (1–3 phrases)
•	Inputs/Gates: Inputs, Hard_Gates
•	Resolution: Resolution_Method
o	Randomizer allowed only if Cadence PE defines it; otherwise mark “requires player delegation at runtime”.
•	Effects: Outputs, State_Updates, Clock_Cascades (existing clocks only), Run_Cap_Notes, Failure_Safes, Audit_Notes
Boundaries (HARD):
•	No canon invention; no new named NPC/faction/Zone as facts.
•	No clocks created inside PE-DEF.
•	Respect registry immutability once registered.
Output (HARD):
•	Emit one full PE-DEF in exact template order; then STOP.
