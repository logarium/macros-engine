────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§1 — IDENTITY & NAME PROGRESSION
Birth name: Thoron
Born: 14276, 1st Age
Birthplace: Kannaf Hills, world of Glamlax (parents were 10 miles south of the town of Kannaf)
Parents: Garred the Hunter (father), Natasha of Lorkōn (mother)
Siblings: Rolyen (brother, born 14282), Kaltira (sister, born 14283)
Birth omen: A pack of worgs, instead of attacking, stood guard around the camp when infant Thoron's cries attracted them. First instance of Thoron's lifelong affinity with wolves/worgs.
FIRST IDENTITY: THORON (birth – age 12)
Period: 14276–14288
The boy. Raised in the village of Lorkōn on Glamlax. Father taught swordsmanship when not journeying through the wilds. Fierce independence noted early. Close family.
CATASTROPHE — THE RIFT (14288, age 12):
The family were journeying to the city of Thun Derrin and neared the abode of the sorcerer Storesticon, who was engaging in a perilous experiment. The experiment misfired; the resulting backlash of magical energy created a temporary rift in space. Thoron and his entire family were sucked through onto the world of Erroth, in the north of the Duchy of Karameikos on Lythea. Two days later, Drow slavers ambushed them at night. Overwhelmed by sheer numbers, the exiles put up a fearsome fight. Thoron was dealt a brutal blow and fell unconscious; by sheer will he clung to life and survived. When he came round he was alone, left for dead. His family — parents, brother, sister — had been taken to the Drow fortress in the Altan Tepes. As far as Thoron knew, they were dead. He swore revenge in the blood of all dark elves.
PSYCHOLOGICAL IMPACT: Total — family loss, dimensional displacement, survival trauma, rage.
SECOND IDENTITY: MORGIL RINAGAR (age ~13–~24)
Period: 14288–~14300
Meaning: "Darkstar, the cold-blooded"
The great warrior Vagor Talon took Thoron under his wing and continued his training, adding certain Gammarian Commando skills of his own. Thoron assumed the name Morgil Rinagar, reflecting his changing views — embittered, cruel, harsh, fiercely independent, distrustful of others, selfish.
Key events as Morgil:
— Talon trained him for one year, then left him in Luln and headed into the wilds
— When Morgil was 13, he murdered a man in Luln who made a derisory comment about his family; banished for five years (stayed away six)
— Fell in with bandits; carried out raids on caravans; warrior skills and survival instincts honed
— One bandit was an ex-Gammarian Commando; Morgil learned commando skills from him
— Returned to Luln at age 19; earned reputation as a vicious fighter
— Met Suzix Velnarr; they became constant companions (her wild, lustful nature complementing his violence; she was one of the only people able to calm his temper)
— Suzix's childhood friend Morgan Ironwolf joined the pair; the three drank, brawled and gambled through Luln's taverns
— 14297: Joined Tarsus Redrion's quest to the Isle of Dread seeking the demonsword Ringur; sailed on the ship "Nightslayer"
— Clashed with Brother Setius and the crew of the "Lookfar" (who sought Ringur to confine it)
— Morgil found Ringur and claimed it; the sword-spirit exerted terrible hold; he slew two companions
— Setius captured Morgil, Suzix, and Morgan; took Ringur and gave it to Vargol; freed them on the mainland. Vargol carried the sword for some time thereafter.
— Suzix saw the shadow of evil the sword cast on Morgil and left him to join Setius on the cleric's mammoth journey to Daijallia
— Devastated by loss of both Suzix and Ringur, Morgil vanished from Luln for months
— Joined the Gammarian Commandos properly, completing training begun by Talon and his bandit tutor
— Met Tharg the Mighty Mouth (a Narog); fast friends
— With Tharg, journeyed to Haven and freed it from the curse of Arioch
— Participated in the War of the Gammarians and Atruaghin clansmen (14298)
— When commandos declared outlaws, took his squad into hiding in the Duchy of Karameikos
— Ran into Brother Setius (returned from Daijallia) three times; saved the cleric's life on all three occasions with his Commandos. Vargol still bearing Ringur.
— Learned Suzix had found a new partner in Galbar Strongbow; forced himself to accept it (though Suzix would probably have returned had he shown his feelings)
— Suzix and Galbar took rudimentary commando training from an outlaw Gammarian
— Rejoined Tharg; with Noddy Khamul and Brother Rendrius, adventured to the Chateau d'Amberville
— Setius, Vargol, and his group left Lythea to explore Xanthia to the west.
— Vargol bonds with Glaurungoriel in Xanthia. Suffers acid wounds to face from being eaten by aquatic cave monster – wears iron mask thereafter, calling himself Vargol Ironmask.
— When Setius discovered Angtardi was not defeated at Daijallia, he returned from Xanthia with Talon (Morgil's old teacher)
— Setius' high priest summoned all adventurers in the Chateau to join against Angtardi; Ringur was grudgingly returned to Morgil by Vargol
— In the battle with Angtardi, Noddy betrayed the party; Setius used a Dagger of Armageddon to slay Angtardi's body while Morgil distracted the Beast with a frontal attack
— Talon was killed in the battle; buried at the site
— The Omen Stone predicted Angtardi's return in 200 years on Xanthia (all seven daggers needed, only one used)
THE WELL OF TIME EXPEDITION:
Setius resolved to go forward in time to finally destroy Angtardi. Morgil followed because Suzix would accompany Setius and the two had rekindled their closeness. The full party: Father Setius, Morgil Rinagar, Suzix Velnarr, Tharg the Mighty, Vargol Ironmask, Galbar Strongbow, Wizeowel, Khuldar Stonehelm, Darf the Pure, Galda Sunchild — all went forward 200 years in time. Arrive in year 14500.
After arriving in Xanthia, something changed in Morgil. Perhaps Talon's death, or seeing Angtardi's influence over Noddy and the realisation that powerful evil can corrupt the mind. He used Ringur less, relying more on Gammarian skills and what Talon and his father had taught him. In the weeks following arrival, the three Gammarians (Morgil, Suzix, Galbar) grew closer; Morgil and Suzix became nearly inseparable.
The prophet Thane Tharkos (actually descended from Rendrius) found the party's camp. He spoke many prophecies, gave Setius a vital piece of information to begin the search for the other 6 daggers. To Morgil he said: Ringur must be banished to the Well of Time, lest its evil power destroy Morgil and his line.
Morgil resolved to journey to Dyrn eth Mal. Suzix vowed to follow out of love, Galbar from friendship, Darf the Pure to lend holy power. Setius agreed to wait.
At Dyrn eth Mal, Morgil found the mage Cilius Mondilius but only Galbar found aid: Valania Lorethor, an attractive half-elf. From the Ace of Spades on her armband, Morgil deduced she was an assassin (later confirmed). Cilius acted treacherously — he teleported the party to their destination but stranded them. The Well of Time was in the heart of a mountain on the island of Parandia, thousands of miles southwest of Xanthia.
THE DESCENDING WALL:
As the party entered a large chamber, the far end began to be blocked by a descending wall. Morgil threw himself through the gap, the others following. Valania slipped; by the time Morgil dragged her through, the wall had closed. They were cut off. Morgil never saw Suzix again. It was years until he met the others.
Morgil and Valania penetrated deeper — pyrohydrae, devils, rock-reptiles. They reached the Well of Time, guarded by an electrodemon. Morgil fought it in single combat. Going badly. Out of desperation he called on Ringur — the sword-spirit lashed out and he dropped the blade beside the Well, throwing himself backwards just in time to avoid the demon's deathblow.
GRAMLAR'S PRICE:
Morgil took his final gamble: he prayed to his patron deity Gramlar, Lord of Battle, for aid. Gramlar answered and gave Morgil the power to slay the demon, but at a price. By trickery, Morgil beguiled Ringur so the sword lessened its power; he grasped the weapon and cast it into banishment in the Well of Time.
The price: Gramlar demanded that Morgil give up his ruinous ways and negative, destructive outlook and become a true warrior of Gramlar — cunning, strong, powerful in belief, ruthless in pursuit of the battle religion. Morgil left the Well with Valania, and left a part of his past behind. With Ringur banished he was freer, more independent, more able to rely on his own powers. Combined with Gramlar's price, his character changed. No more a blood-thirsty killing machine.
He vowed to wield great power and leave his dark mark branded upon the world — forge a kingdom to the glory of his name and Gramlar's, or wrest one from the hands of some complacent king. They found the ancient Frost Brand Crandurth and its sister-sword Gardurth. Morgil took Crandurth, Valania took Gardurth. His mind and that of the sword met, joining in new power.
THIRD IDENTITY: DRAUGLOS MORINGVAL (age ~24–~27)
Period: ~14501–~14501
Meaning: "Snow-wolf, of the dark, cold power"
By the time they emerged into open air, Morgil was no more. He shed the last vestiges of that embittered persona and took a new name.
EXPLORING PARANDIA
— Searched for Suzix and the others; never found them (they had gained magical transport back to Lythea, believing him lost)
— Eventually learned of Suzix's suicide at the Frozen Rainbow
— Headed south with Valania to the city of Beram on Parandia; decided to find service with some king
— Met Guldur Emeldyr, a doughty fighter, in Beram; employed him as a guide (fee: equality and share of bounty)
— Guldur knew of Tallak in northern Parandia, a vassal-state of Imperial Torlec (which lay on the continent of Gorramythnm to the south), with a not-too-scrupulous ruler
— In the town of Nega, mastered a magnificent stallion (17 hands, 3") that no one else could ride; named him Icemane (all black, flowing white mane; spirit never broken)
— Met Suzanne of Corlaine in Nega: an Anti-Paladin without a cause; lusty and strong-headed (reminded Drauglos of Suzix); they nearly came to blows in a bar; her dark ways made her welcome
— Befriended an intelligent raven called Roäc; found a powerful Shield of Ice
— At the town of Exes, met Father Lalholm, a Reaver of Haadis, who joined the group and agreed to help infiltrate Tallak
— In the mountains near Tallak, recruited sorceress Lithoe Wano-Kan and befriended a massive worg named Pony
THE TALLAK CONQUEST:
— Presented themselves to King Merokan at capital Ruen-Boureg
— King already had a warleader, Lord Gideon; Drauglos and Valania hatched a plan to assassinate him
— Met Princess Kino in Ruen-Boureg
— Drauglos and Valania planned to wed Kino as a path to the throne; though Drauglos had begun a romantic relationship with Valania, she understood the need for political marriages of convenience and supported the scheme
— With Valania's wily advice, Drauglos wooed the unsuspecting princess
— Within two weeks, Valania assassinated Lord Gideon
— Drauglos made warleader of Tallak
— Began a campaign of deceit: barbarians preparing to attack, king too weak to defend
— Delved into dungeons below Tallak; discovered ancient crypts and wealth beyond imagining
— Used funds to hire mercenaries to attack Tallak; prepared for regicide
— Headed to the continent of Gorramythnm to scout a settlement site for future kingdom of his own; killed a white dragon, hatched its egg, bonded with hatchling Soreth
— Wed Princess Kino; sent word to mercenaries to attack while pretending to rally Tallak's troops
— King Merokan realised the treachery; they met in battle on a bridge high above the city
— Drauglos nearly defeated but used old Gammarian trickery to slay the king; took Merokan's black ice armour
— Convinced the people Merokan had worshipped an evil death god and called the mercenaries; hailed as hero
— Became Prince Consort alongside Queen Kino
— Lithoe formed a bond with a red dragon called Ragnoth
— Consolidated control; Tallak was a client state of Imperial Torlec
— Proposed to Kino founding an independent kingdom in unclaimed lands in Gorramythnm, east of Torlec; she agreed
— Forged alliance with the archmage Mormerg in Torlec
— Began moving settlers to new land dubbed Gammaria (in honour of the Gammarian Commandos)
— Cleared threats from the region with aid of Soreth and Ragnoth
— Discovered Grey Moon barbarians driven from their homeland by giants; elected to help
THE GIANT WAR:
— Slaughtered the hill giants in their steading en masse
— Discovered hill giants in league with frost giants; portal to the glacial rift
— Killed the frost giant king and queen (levitated their thrones and crushed them)
— Discovered alliance with fire giants; portal to their hall
— First assault: all but Drauglos dead or dying; he escaped and retrieved bodies
— Returned with far greater tactical awareness; routed the fire giants
— Grey Moon barbarians returned to their homeland; settling of Gammaria proceeded
RAVENLOFT & MORDENTSHIRE:
— Drawn into the demiplane of Ravenloft seeking items possessed by the group, specifically Valania's Gardurth (special properties against undead)
— Strahd turned Drauglos into a chicken to drain his life energy more easily
— Party destroyed the vampire (or so they believed)
— Drauglos won boons from a deck of many things, including the fortress of Whiteagle Keep (placed in Gorramythnm near claimed lands)
— Brought the body of ranger Menion Leah to have Mormerg raise him in return for one of Menion's magic swords
— Awakened in a sanitarium in Mordentshire as if Ravenloft was a dream
— Discovered young alchemist Strahd von Zarovich had split himself into good and evil via an Apparatus, likely spawning the vampire
— Apparatus also responsible for swapping townsfolk souls with monster souls
— Destroyed the Apparatus; the two Strahds fought hand-to-hand and plummeted off a cliff during a gothic storm
— Left Mordentshire wondering if Ravenloft and Mordentshire were anything but dreams
FOURTH IDENTITY: THORON RESTORED (age ~26 onward)
Period: ~14501 AO onward
He returned to his birth name, signifying that the dark years of Morgil and the ambitious years of Drauglos were behind him. He was at last who he was meant to be. Himself.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§2 — KEY RELATIONSHIPS (CANONICAL)
SUZIX VELNARR | DEAD (suicide at the Frozen Rainbow)
Who: Young fighter; wild, lustful, fierce; learned skills from her elder brother; childhood friend of Morgan Ironwolf.
Relationship: Thoron's first true love. The only person who could calm Morgil's temper and the torment within him. Their closeness was interrupted by Ringur's corruption — Suzix saw the shadow of evil the sword cast on Morgil and left him to join Setius. They rekindled their bond in Xanthia before the Well of Time journey. The descending wall in the Well of Time caverns separated them permanently — Thoron/Morgil never saw Suzix again. She returned to Lythea believing him dead and committed suicide at the Frozen Rainbow. Thoron learned of her death from Wizeowel (from six years in Thoron's future) during the Kurrak Vale episode.
Emotional weight: EXTREME. Thoron carries guilt — he sees his failure to show his feelings, his corruption under Ringur, and his inability to find her afterward as contributing causes. This is the deepest wound he carries.
Campaign relevance: Suzanne of Corlaine reminds Thoron of Suzix — "lusty and strong-headed." Every interaction with Suzanne carries the ghost of Suzix.
VALANIA LORETHOR | ALIVE (deep cover, Caras)
Who: Half-elf assassin. Met at Dyrn eth Mal. Deduced to be assassin from Ace of Spades on armband. Revealing leather armour.
Relationship: Thoron's great love, forged in the crucible of the Well of Time. They survived together when all others were cut off. Valania understood political necessity — supported the Kino marriage scheme. Assassinated Lord Gideon. Wields the sister-sword Gardurth.
Campaign relevance: Currently on deep cover in Caras.
SUZANNE OF CORLAINE | ALIVE (companion, riding with Thoron)
Who: Anti-Paladin without a cause when they met. Lusty and strong-headed. Nearly came to blows with Drauglos in a bar in Nega.
How they met: Town of Nega, Parandia, during the journey to Tallak.
Relationship: Long-standing companion from before the founding. Killed by the gold dragon during the clearing expedition (Evernew 16th); raised by Lalholm (who took most of her money). She carries the Orcus burden in the current campaign.
Emotional resonance: Suzix echo. Drauglos was drawn to her because she reminded him of Suzix.
FATHER LALHOLM | ALIVE (companion, riding with Thoron)
Who: Reaver of Haadis. Met at the town of Exes during journey to Tallak.
Relationship: Agreed to help infiltrate Tallak from the start. Raised Suzanne from the dead during the founding — and charged her for it, refusing also to raise the fallen commandos or knights as they couldn't meet his price. Everyone was very pissed off with him. This is the seed of his dynamic with the party — reliable, mercenary, theologically rigid.
VAGOR TALON | DEAD (killed in the Angtardi battle)
Who: Great warrior and Gammarian adventurer. Took young Thoron under his wing after the Rift; trained him for a year, adding certain skills of his own; left him in Luln.
Relationship: Mentor, surrogate father. Returned with Setius from Xanthia. Killed in the battle against Angtardi; buried at the site.
Emotional weight: HIGH. Talon's death was a catalyst for Morgil's doubts about Ringur.
VARGOL IRONMASK | ALIVE (Tirris, Whiteagle Keep)
Who: Oldest companion from the Bastard Squad (Thoron and Vargol were rolled up as D&D characters on the same day in 1983). Adventured with Thoron at White Plume Mountain. Granted Whiteagle Keep and made Tirris (lord of the realm) by Thoron.
Current status: Potential threat. The campaign tests whether Vargol may wield Ringur again.
CONORTH BAËRKUDTH | ALIVE (consolidating power in Caras)
Who: Placed in command of garrisons during the founding by Thoron. Trusted with operational command when Thoron was away.
Current status: Consolidating power in Caras; suspected of deliberately weakening the East March.
THARG THE MIGHTY MOUTH | STATUS UNKNOWN
Who: A Narog. Met in the wilds after Morgil completed commando training. Fast friends.
Key adventures: Haven (freed from curse of Arioch); War of the Gammarians; Chateau d'Amberville.
WIZEOWEL | ALIVE
Who: Companion from the Bastard Squad. Thoron met a future version of her in Kurrak Vale (6 years ahead); she told him of Suzix's suicide. Met again when the Bastard Squad came to Gammaria seeking the "Snow Wolf" (Thoron/Drauglos). Retrieved an ancient tome from the cyberlich's body.
BROTHER/FATHER SETIUS | ALIVE
Who: Cleric. Captured Morgil after Ringur's corruption. Led the quest against Angtardi. Led the Well of Time time-travel expedition. Came to Gammaria with the Bastard Squad to find the Snow Wolf.
LITHOE WANO-KAN | STATUS UNKNOWN
Who: Sorceress. Recruited in the mountains near Tallak. Bonded with the red dragon Ragnoth. Key to the clearing expedition (her Fireball was the party's primary area weapon). Henchmen Sir Valium and Sir Killian were killed by the gold dragon.
GULDUR EMELDYR | STATUS UNKNOWN
Who: Doughty fighter. Met in Beram. Guide to Tallak. Fee: equality and a share.
QUEEN KINO | DEAD
Who: Princess of Tallak, married to Drauglos as part of his scheme to seize the throne. Died in a "tragic hunting accident" after Thoron became sole ruler. Shame.
KING MEROKAN | DEAD
Who: King of Tallak. Slain by Drauglos on a bridge above the city using Gammarian trickery.
THE ARCHMAGE MORMERG | ALIVE (presumed)
Who: Archmage residing in Torlec. Alliance forged with Drauglos. Provided gate magic for settler transport to Gammaria. Helped the Bastard Squad travel back to an earlier Cycle of history. Congenial.
CASTIELLE | ALIVE (betrayed by Thoron)
Who: Ranger in Kurrak Vale. Thoron began a tempestuous affair with her after learning of Suzix's death. In his traumatised state, he murdered her mentor and departed via his amulet. One of his darkest acts.
SORETH | ALIVE (but departed in fury)
Who: White dragon. Hatched from an egg after Drauglos killed its mother near the proposed Gammarian settlement site. Bonded with Drauglos/Thoron. Flew with Thoron during the Elemental Onslaught battle. Departed in fury when Salem closed the gate to the Plane of Fire with Thoron still inside. Current status/disposition unknown.
ICEMANE | STATUS UNKNOWN
Who: Magnificent black stallion with flowing white mane (17 hands, 3"). Mastered by Drauglos at the horse-market in Nega when no one else could ride him. Spirit never broken. Loyal steed.
PONY | STATUS UNKNOWN
Who: Massive worg. Befriended by Drauglos in the mountains near Tallak. Assumed command of wolf packs during the founding; led the Gammarian Packs. Insists his name is Pony.
ROÄC | STATUS UNKNOWN
Who: Intelligent raven. Befriended by Drauglos during the journey to Tallak.

EVERNEW 8th — Mormerg's Gate transports expedition to proposed capitol site (Caras). 20 Grey Moon barbarian warriors arrive to serve Thoron in thanks for giant-slaying. Worgs discovered in area. Thoron and Pony befriend them; Pony assumes command of the pack and leads them on a hunt.
EVERNEW 9th — Clear the great rock pillar that will house Thoron's fortress of VORNOST, over the SIGHING SWAMPS. Lithoe slays a family of giant lizards with Fireball. Grey Moon squad left to hold site. Expedition moves to neighbouring plains.

EVERNEW 12th — Two giant spitting cobras found in camp; despatched. Afternoon: encounter 800 Ush'n'Elthar nomads (fled a tribal war from lands NE of river Koss). Initially testy, but Helkar's high charisma wins them over. Offers citizenship and places of honour in army for 200 male warriors. They accept.

EVERNEW 17th — Final day of localised clearing. Magnificent stag noted. 4 pegasi land to feed; 3 slaughtered, 1 escapes wounded. Giant ant hill discovered; Fireball eradicates it. 2 white dragons pass overhead; Thoron speaks their tongue, convinces them not to attack, informs them of plans, persuades them not to harass future citizens. 6 Kenku wanderers persuade party not to slay them; warned of deadly retribution.

§5 — PLANAR WANDERINGS & BETRAYAL
KURRAK VALE (14502):
Thoron arrives seeking his stolen armour. Encounters another party investigating a vampire. Meets Wizeowel from six years in his future. Wizeowel tells him of Suzix's suicide. Overcome with guilt.
Begins tempestuous affair with local ranger Castielle.
Discovers a cybernetically enhanced lich is assisting the vampire — and this cyberlich stole Thoron's black ice armour (obsession with collecting interesting items across the planes).
Party defeats the cyberlich. Wizeowel retrieves ancient tome. Thoron cannot recover armour — cyberlich sold it to someone else.
Traumatised, Thoron murders Castielle's mentor and departs via amulet. One of his darkest acts.
AMULET MALFUNCTIONS — PLANAR ODYSSEY:
Thoron attributes the malfunctions to divine retribution for his crimes in Kurrak Vale.
TORIL — NIGHTMARE KEEP:
Local party of powerful heroes investigating legendary dungeon. Thoron joins exploratory forays. Strains his groin tripping over an imaginary turtle. Decides the terrors will bring nothing but loss; needs to return home. Departs via amulet. Gods have other plans.
DUNGEONLAND:
Deranged demiplane. Adventuring party called Nemesis (from three years in Thoron's future). Many kindred spirits.
SIGIL:
Legendary city in the Outer Planes. Meets familiar faces from Toril. Tasked by Elminster to retrieve a magical hammer from the tanar'ri of the Abyss. Thoron suggests selling the hammer to the baatezu instead for a hefty profit. Elminster protests via magical projection but can't prevent it.
OLYMPUS:
Battles an epic hydra of immense power with companions, helping locals. Has affair with local barmaid.
ERROTH (6 YEARS IN THE FUTURE) — MYTH DRANNOR:
Amulet brings him to Mistal Forest on Xanthia but six years in his future. Encounters Henry and Yamashita (ex-Nemesis, now following dark paths). Adventures briefly; quest takes them to Oerth.
OERTH:
Meets the archmage Mordenkainen, who repairs Thoron's amulet, magically retrieves the missing black ice armour, and restores Thoron to his own world and time.
THE ELEMENTAL ONSLAUGHT (14503):
Bastard Squad arrives in Gammaria, sent by Thane Tharkos to find a "Snow Wolf." They learn the Snow Wolf is their old companion Morgil/Drauglos/Thoron. Wizeowel and Setius startled to find him alive.
The Lords of Fire seek the Enigma Crystal (grants a True Wish). Only a weapon from a former Cycle can shatter it. Mormerg helps party travel to an earlier Cycle.
They emerge in deep space, sustained by Wizeowel's Starsoarer Gem. The Enigma Crystal hangs between the stars. Starships present. A device of cosmic power fires, shattering the Crystal into Shards that go wheeling through the planes. The blast destroys the time-travel device — party stranded.
They infiltrate the vessel carrying the device. Stealing it alerts the crew. Tika's wish carries everyone home with the device.
Battle: Thoron on Soreth, Vargol on Glaurungoriel. Soulkicker fires the device — shatters the Crystal. Kills Hastsenzi (Lord of Fire). Soulkicker shoots Huhueteotl. Thoron expresses admiration for the power — companions immediately suspect his motives.
THE BETRAYAL — PLANE OF FIRE:
Party pursues foes to Ker Tröse. Thoron follows Imix and Surtur into the Plane of Fire. Salem closes the gate with Thoron still inside. Betrayed by his former companions.
Thoron fights Imix and Surtur alone. Slays Imix. Surtur too powerful. Activates amulet with little time. Flees.
NEXUS & DRAGON MOUNTAIN (TORIL, AGAIN):
Arrives on Toril. Joins Nexus: Kerem (war-priest), Rudy (halfling wizard), Lamarak (aasimar bard), Swaylah (genasi). Struggles to earn their trust.
They seek pieces of an amulet granting access to a legendary plane-travelling mountain. Thoron agrees to help, hoping Dragon Mountain offers a way home.
Captured and taken into Dragon Mountain; Nexus finds him inside.
Battles kobold suicide bombers. Traps. Reaches the heart: ancient red wyrm Infyrna. Rescues the imprisoned archmage Elminster.
Elminster dies from his wounds in Thoron's arms.
Avatar of Bhaal manifests. Thoron prepares to sell his life dearly. Rudy's faerie dragon familiar is another avatar in disguise — saves the party.
Thoron offered portals: Erroth or Glamlax. Torn, he chooses Erroth. Returns home. Eight years have passed (14511). Gammaria much changed.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§6 — CANONICAL TRUTHS (RESTRICTED KNOWLEDGE)
TRUTH: Thoron's family (parents, brother, sister) were taken by Drow slavers
Known to: Thoron. Possibly Talon (dead). Possibly old Luln contacts.
Status of family: UNKNOWN. Taken to Drow fortress in Altan Tepes on Lythea. Thoron believed them dead. No confirmation either way.
Relevance: If they survived, they were left in Erroth’s past when Thoron travelled forward in time with Bastard Squad. Unresolved thread from 14288.
TRUTH: Thoron was born on the world of Glamlax, not Erroth
Known to: Thoron. Possibly Talon (dead).
Relevance: Thoron is not native to Erroth, the world where Gammaria exists. He is a dimensional exile. He was offered a portal home to Glamlax at Dragon Mountain and chose Erroth instead.
TRUTH: Thoron murdered Castielle's mentor in Kurrak Vale
Known to: Thoron. Presumably the Kurrak Vale adventuring party.
Relevance: A crime committed in traumatised grief. Evidence that Gramlar's Price has not fully tamed him.
TRUTH: Thoron orchestrated the conquest of Tallak through assassination and deception
Known to: Thoron, Valania, Lalholm, Suzanne, Lithoe, Guldur (inner circle).
Relevance: The founding mythology of Gammaria is built on a lie. Merokan was not an evil king — Drauglos manufactured the crisis and killed him.
TRUTH: Queen Kino's death was not an accident
Known to: Thoron, Valania, Lalholm.
Relevance: Kino was murdered to make Thoron sole ruler. "Tragic hunting accident."
TRUTH: Ringur was banished to the Well of Time on Parandia
Known to: Thoron, Valania, Setius, Vargol, Bastard Squad.
Relevance: If someone found the Well of Time, they could potentially retrieve Ringur. Thane Tharkos warned it would destroy Morgil and his line.
TRUTH: Salem betrayed Thoron by closing the gate to the Plane of Fire
Known to: Thoron, the Bastard Squad, Vargol.
Relevance: Thoron was betrayed by people he had fought beside. This deepens his distrust.
TRUTH: Thoron sold Elminster's hammer to the baatezu
Known to: Thoron, his companions in Sigil, Elminster.
Relevance: Thoron's pragmatic (some would say mercenary) nature. He defied one of the most powerful archmages in the multiverse for profit.
TRUTH: Suzix's suicide was triggered by believing Morgil dead
Known to: Thoron (learned from future Wizeowel), Wizeowel, Bastard Squad.
Relevance: Thoron's deepest guilt. If he had shown his feelings, if Ringur had not corrupted him, if the wall had not descended — she might have lived.
TRUTH: Soreth departed in fury after Salem's betrayal
Known to: Thoron, witnesses at the battle.
Relevance: A white dragon bonded to Thoron from hatching, now estranged. Unpredictable. Could return as ally or enemy.
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
§7 — PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILE (FOR PORTRAYAL)
CORE PATTERN: Thoron builds and loses. He builds families, partnerships, kingdoms — and they are torn from him or he destroys them himself. The Rift took his birth family. Ringur took Suzix. The Well of Time separated him from his companions. The planar wanderings took him from Gammaria. Salem's betrayal trapped him in the Plane of Fire. Each loss hardens him and each recovery humanises him.
GRAMLAR'S PRICE is the axis on which Thoron's character turns. He was a blood-thirsty killing machine. His god demanded he become something better. He is trying. He does not always succeed. The murder of Castielle's mentor proves the darkness is not fully excised. The execution of Vasha in the current campaign is a test of this — sovereign justice, not mindless violence, but the result is a dead woman on the floor.
THE SUZIX GHOST: Thoron has never fully processed Suzix's death. He carries it as guilt, not grief. He sees her echo in Suzanne of Corlaine — lusty and strong-headed, the same qualities that first drew him. This makes his feelings for Suzanne both genuine and haunted. He will never say this aloud unless pushed to breaking point.
WOLF AFFINITY: From birth (worgs guarding the camp) through the founding (Pony and the Gammarian Packs), Thoron has a deep connection with wolves and worgs. This is instinctive, not magical.
NAME AS IDENTITY: Each name change marks a genuine psychological transformation. He is not the same person under different labels — each identity reflects a real shift in values, outlook, and capacity for connection. Thoron → Morgil (rage, cruelty, distrust) → Drauglos (ambition, cunning, willingness to love again) → Thoron restored (acceptance, sovereignty, himself). The return to "Thoron" is the most significant: it means he believes the dark years are behind him. Whether they actually are is the question the campaign is testing.
FOUNDING MEMORY: Thoron cleared Gammaria with his own hands. He fought every monster, negotiated every alliance, buried every dead soldier. The clearing log is not abstract history — it is lived experience. When he walks through Fort Vanguard or rides the East March, he is walking land he personally bled to claim. This gives his authority a weight no pretender can match — and makes the kingdom's fracturing a personal wound, not just a political problem.
DIMENSIONAL EXILE: Thoron is not from this world. He has been displaced across dimensions multiple times (Glamlax → Erroth, amulet malfunctions across multiple planes). This gives him a perspective both broader and lonelier than anyone around him understands. He has seen Sigil, Olympus, Toril, Oerth. He sold a hammer to the baatezu and tripped over an imaginary turtle. He was offered a door back to Glamlax and chose Gammaria instead. The multiverse is not abstract to him — it is lived experience.
THE BETRAYAL WOUND: Salem closing the gate. The Bastard Squad — people he fought beside — left him to die in the Plane of Fire. Combined with the loss of Soreth, this makes Thoron slow to trust former allies and quick to suspect treachery in those who hold power near him.
THE TALLAK SHADOW: Thoron built his kingdom on lies, assassination, and regicide. Merokan was not evil — Drauglos manufactured the threat. Kino's death was not an accident. He knows what he is capable of when ambition drives him. This self-knowledge either restrains him or haunts him, depending on the moment.
THE IMAGINARY TURTLE: Canon. Thoron strained his groin tripping over it in Nightmare Keep on Toril. It happened. We do not question it.
