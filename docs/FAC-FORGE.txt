FAC-FORGE
1 NPC MANAGEMENT MACRO
1.1 Trigger: FAC-FORGE

2 INPUTS (by caller):
2.1 ZONE-FORGE mode (structured):
2.1.1 Required:
2.1.1.1 Zone_Scope: (existing Zone/region from authoritative state)
2.1.1.2 Faction_Function: (role/purpose of this faction)
2.1.1.3 Optional (with defaults):
2.1.1.4 Visibility_Policy: (known/secret, default: known)
2.1.1.5 Max_NPCs: (override default 3, range 0-5)
2.1.1.6 Max_Clocks: (override default 3, range 0-5)
2.1.2 Protocol: all inputs in structured block. Missing required → HARD STOP + log to ADJUDICATION_LOG.
2.2 Player mode (freeform):
2.2.1 Source: player text + authoritative state (NSV-FACTIONS / JSON save / PARTY-SEED)
2.3 Inputs: taken from:
2.3.1 Player mode: player text in this invocation + authoritative state
2.3.2 ZONE-FORGE mode: structured input from caller + authoritative state

3 Canon Discipline (HARD):
3.1 Unsupported detail = UNKNOWN / INFERRED (do not promote to fact).
3.1.1 Consult LORE-FACTIONS and LORE-WORLD for canonical faction and world history before creating factions; new factions must not duplicate or contradict existing canonical factions or established historical events.
3.2 Do NOT introduce >3 named NPCs unless player explicitly authorises more.
3.3 Do NOT narrate scenes or outcomes.

4 Clock Discipline (HARD):
4.1 Max clocks per FAC-FORGE = 3 total (or Max_Clocks override if provided)
4.2 Faction-owned or UA-owned only
4.3 NPC-owned clocks require NPC-FORGE to run first (NPC must exist in authoritative state)
4.4 Full clock fields required

5 OUTPUT MODE (based on Caller):
5.1 Player mode: emit all 4 blocks (FACTION PROFILE (concise), NPC CADRE (up to 3 stubs), DELTA INSERTS, CLOCK INSERTS)
5.2 ZONE-FORGE mode: emit blocks 3-4 only (DELTA INSERTS, CLOCK INSERTS); suppress blocks 1-2

6 Hard Stops:
6.1 Any attempt to resolve AGENCY ACTIONS or time → HARD STOP
6.2 Any contradiction with existing canon:
6.2.1 Player mode: STOP and request ruling
6.2.2 ZONE-FORGE mode: HARD STOP with error logged to ADJUDICATION_LOG; abort this FAC-FORGE call
