TEMPLATES (v3.0)

NOTE (v4.0): NSV-DELTA and PARTY-DELTA templates below are HISTORICAL REFERENCE ONLY.
The JSON save file is the canonical state format. Delta text files are no longer generated.
Templates for clocks, NPCs, factions, relationships, discoveries, ELs, zones, PEs,
and entity cards remain valid as field-set references for JSON save entries.

CLOCKS & PRESSURE
CLK: [Clock_Name] | [Clock_Owner] | [Progress] | [Advanced_This_Session: Y/N] | [Trigger_Fired: —/text]
ADV: [advances_when bullets, semicolon-separated] | HALT: [halts_when] | RED: [reduces_when]
TRG: [trigger_on_completion]

Note: Use "(none)" for empty HALT/RED fields. Semicolons separate multiple conditions in ADV.

CLOCK ENTRY FORMAT (HARD):
In NSV-DELTA, each clock MUST be written using the full standard clock field set exactly as templated under CLOCKS & PRESSURE.
Shorthand clock lines (e.g., “Clock Name — 1/4”) are INVALID in NSV-DELTA.

MISSING DEFINITION RULE (HARD):
A clock is INVALID if any of the following are empty/omitted:
• Clock_Name
• Clock_Owner
• Progress
• Advances_When
• Trigger_On_Completion
The following fields MAY be explicitly set to “(none)”:
• Halts_When
• Reduces_When
A clock with Advances_When set to “Dormant (no triggers defined yet)” is permitted, but then:
• Progress MUST be 0
• Trigger_Fired MUST be blank unless changed this session

Invalid clocks MUST be corrected or removed under ERROR CORRECTION MACRO.

SNAPSHOT RULE (HARD):
All still-active clocks MUST be fully restated every delta, even if unchanged.
