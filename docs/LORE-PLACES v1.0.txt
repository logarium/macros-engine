BARROW MOORS
A bleak heath to the north of Gammaria, this haunted place is actually a remnant of the People of the Henge. A settlement of theirs once clung to the Eastern Scarps many ages past - nothing remains of it now save the barrows where these primitive humans buried their dead. Most stay dead. Tussocks of grass dot rolling heath. Stunted trees. Startlingly beautiful wildflowers. Dolmens. Barrows. Muffled sounds from within. Wildlife: falcons, hares, very aggressive goats. Smells of black soil and old bones.

BLACKTOOTH FOREST
Deciduous forest (oaks, beech, silver birch), ferns, stags, foxes, giant owls, snakes, spiders, wasps, wolves. Alive, brooding, aware, ancient.
Blacktooth Orcs came here following Elemental Onslaught - they've been living here for over six thousand years. They've learned to endure where all others have failed or are failing. They have settled camps throughout the forest and their shamans communicate using the mycelial network connecting all living things in the forest.

CARAS
This is where Gammaria began. A keep conjured by the Deck of Many Things, then an immense portal created by a archmage, then settlers and builders and farmers and families willing to brave a new frontier in order to be free of an empire. That spirit still endures - and with it is mixed the bravery of the Grey Moon barbarians, the fervour of the Ush nomads, the wisdom of the Blacktooth, and assorted gnomes, dwarves, and even the occasional Bloodswamp hobgoblin. Merchants thrive amidst the dust (or mud, when raining of the Grey Plains). Gammarian troops are ever-present. Conorth rules from the magically constructed Caras Keep. Horses, cattle, markets, soldiers, dervishes, nomads. The queues at the Grey Gate. It's a lot.

DEEP SWAMPS
this iss where it ssleeps it knows you are here building your litle castles and your forts go ahead little king and then we shall see from beneath mire and murk and rush and reed and still black pool where lazy midge circles and foul gas reeks and fell lights flicker and the whispering isn't the wind anymore oh no little king

EAST MARCH
A windswept heath bisected by the Old East Road, the March is moor and gorse and unexpected bogs and little else. It is purple and green and brown and grey and the wind knifes you like you owe it silver. Further east, the sky is a strange colour sometimes. Shaggy cattle dot the moors. Scattered farmsteads are here and there but more and more are abandoned each year as the March grows wilder.

EASTERN SCARPS
Rolling highlands with rugged escarpments and peaks. Wyverns, yes, but also wolves, bears, hawks and falcons and the rare eagle. Occasional copses and hints that people once lived here - arrowheads, stone tools, little more. 

FISHER'S BEACH
The people of Gammaria soon learned that there's something weird about the Sea of Birds. Fisher's Beach is where the catch is best - so long as you tend the shrines. You want to tend the shrines, don't you? Ever wanted to see the inside of a wicker man? No? Thought not. Tend the shrines.

FLOODPLAIN
Here the first real seepages of alien intelligence and ancient powers are felt. Abandoned homesteads of early Gammarian settlers mingle with ancient dwarven works. Strange lights, eerie ethereal noises, and sudden pungencies abound.

FORGAARD
The people at Forgaard know they are holding a line no one else sees. There are things in the Barrow Moors that would murder half of Caras, given the chance. Forgaard is a place of strong walls, strong doors, and strong men and women. They breed great war hounds here - their barking is a constant. As is their smell.

FORT AMON
Gammaria's northernmost outpost, perched where the Causeway meets the edge of Highfell Forest. The garrison here lives in the shadow of the elves and everyone knows it. On the upside, the venison is excellent, cooked to perfection. So long as no one disturbs the Highfell, this is a peaceful place. The fort itself is stone and timber, sturdy but too quiet. It watches the treeline and the treeline watches back. Smells of pine resin, damp stone, wood-smoke. Sounds: wind, and sometimes horns from the deep forest — three notes, descending, never explained.

FORT HIGHGUARD
Southern defensive bastion, high on the approaches above Furdach Forest. Fort Highguard guards the paths from the Hanging Cliffs and the gnome territories below. Its garrison watches southward toward the Gloatburrow Hills, where smoke rises and drums carry on still nights. The fort is austere — no comforts, no market, no tavern. Cliff-falls are a constant danger; the paths here crumble. Fevers sweep through periodically, overwhelming whatever healer they have. Mercenaries desert more often than soldiers. Completed Tryphor 27th, 14503 — one of the last forts built before Thoron vanished.

FORT SEAWATCH
Gammaria's port-fort, loud and rough and proud of it. Fort Seawatch sits where the River of Birds meets the Sea, and everything that floats passes through its canals. Naval supply hub, customs checkpoint, smuggler's paradise. The Kraken Gate opens onto the Seawatch Ramparts and the trade districts beyond. Castellan Merrow Kest tries to hold law and commerce in balance — they say he has sea-blood, or his grandmother was a merrow. Or a fish. Guldur Emeldyr is embedded here, drinking cheap wine and watching Torlec's merchant movements with a smile that doesn't reach his eyes. Brawls are nightly. Press-gangs roam the docks. Warehouses change their seals overnight and nobody asks why. The taverns debate whatever the latest lies are. Beneath the noise, darker currents run: the Cult of Orcus has roots in the Seawatch ossuaries, and the Golden Hind's coin moves through here in quantities that don't match their manifests.

FORT VANGUARD
The eastern edge of everything. Fort Vanguard squats on the Old East Road where it meets the culvert down to the Floodplain, and beyond it there is nothing but the East March and whatever lives past it. Completed Evernew 12th, 14503 — Thoron built this place to hold a line, and it has held it for a decade without him. The garrison is commando-trained, professional, and fraying at the seams. Vanguard was one of the first forts to be commissioned and is proud of it. The fort smells of horse, leather, cold iron, and the particular tension of people who know something is coming but not what. East of here, patrols vanish. Settler expeditions never returned. The tracks in the mud are too large for human, wrong gait for orc. Fort Vanguard doesn't sleep — it watches.

FURDACH
An independent gnome enclave burrowed into the hills south of Furdach Forest. The gnomes of Furdach are not quaint. They are militarised tunnel-fighters locked in a perpetual war with the goblins of the Gloatburrow Hills, and they are losing. Surface visitors are screened by armed patrols — explain yourself or leave. Entry to the tunnels is a rare honour, and those who earn it find a civilization of fierce determination: vaulted passages, mechanical lifts, geothermal forges, and a people who measure their history in goblin wars the way others count kings. They helped found Gammaria and they remember it. The relationship is transactional but honest. Trade disputes flare; tunnel access is leverage. The sound of distant hammering never stops. They are coming.

FURDACH FOREST
Mossy woodland, dark and old. Oaks draped in lichen, ferns waist-deep, shafts of green light where the canopy breaks. Gnome patrols move through it with professional silence — this is their territory and they enforce it. Traps are everywhere: snares, pits, deadfalls, all non-lethal but humiliating. A body strangled and displayed in a tree is gnome justice, and nobody asks what the offence was. Carved warnings on the trunks mean nothing to outsiders; locals flee when they see them. There are older things here too — a moss-covered shrine where wildflowers bloom out of season, a mushroom circle that glows at dusk. Locals say step inside and you never come back. The forest connects to Furdach via narrow tunnel, to the Gloatburrow Hills via scree slopes, to the Southern Scarps via easy track, and to Fort Highguard via high paths. Everything passes through here, and the gnomes see all of it.

GLOATBURROW HILLS
Hell on earth. The goblins own these hills and they will eat you. This is not metaphor. Goblin warbands. Pitfall traps. Slave pens. Feast-sites. Drums and fire and blood. Conorth's Stair climbs to the Hanging Cliffs; the River of Skulls runs down to the River of Birds; a low pass leads to Vargol's Reach; and a goblin tunnel connects to Furdach, where the gnomes fight their endless war against this tide. The Gloatburrow Hills are lethal terrain. Travel through them is not a journey — it's a combat operation or a death sentence, and the goblins don't care which.

GREY PLAINS
The heartland. Dust in summer, mud in spring, and the road between Caras and everywhere else. Merchant caravans converge at crossroads, guards arguing precedence while scribes wave manifests. Nomad banners mark lawful passage at distance. Pilgrims under escort carry official tokens toward the Temple. Patrols on missions covert and otherwise. The Grey Plains are where Gammaria feels most like a country and least like a frontier. Bandits still work the roads, nervous and coordinated in ways that suggest someone is organising them. A farmer's cart breaks down and the Helkar himself fixes it, and nobody recognises him. That's the Grey Plains.

HANGING CLIFFS
Pinnacles of near-inaccessible stone rising between Furdach Forest and the Gloatburrow Hills, accessible from Fort Highguard via Pinnacle Gate and from the goblin hills via Conorth's Stair. Seagulls nest here in screaming colonies and will draw blood defending their roosts. The cliff-paths crumble. A climber's corpse dangles from a rope halfway down, gear intact, cause of death unclear. Hermits live in cliff-face hollows — mad or holy, offering wisdom or violence with equal probability. Rope bridges sway over chasms, some half-cut. Smugglers cache stolen goods in the hollows. The Hanging Cliffs are not a place anyone goes by choice; they're a place people pass through to reach somewhere worse.

HIGHFELL FOREST
Death to all who enter. The elves of Highfell do not negotiate, do not warn twice, and do not explain. This is ancient pine forest — the kind that remembers a time before humans existed and would prefer to return to it. Forest tracks connect to the Narrows, but those who follow them past the cairn line do not come back. An elf path leads to Fort Amon, and the fact that it exists at all is the only evidence of the wary peace between Gammaria and whatever rules in the deep canopy. Horn-calls echo from within — three notes, descending — and this spring they've been more frequent. The elves are stirring. No one knows why. No one alive has been deep enough to ask. No Gammarian knows that the elves of Highfell were sent here from Ard Minya two thousand years ago - they know about the Corrupted Edhellar and they are watching for their ancient cousins.

HINTERLANDS
The western prairie, rolling into sunset. Sweeping vistas, long grass, wind that never stops. The Merchant's Highway runs east to the Grey Plains. Cattle herds move across the landscape, shaggy and wild. Caravans share camp and wine and road-stories. There are homesteads, stone circles where megaliths cast shadows longer than they should, and locals say time runs differently after dark. Wildfire is a constant danger — dry grass and wind and one spark. The Hinterlands feel open and free and that's a lie; there's always something watching from the edge of the grass.

KHUZDUK HILLS
Rolling green hills studded with dwarven ruins. Bears wander the lower slopes — territorial, hungry, unafraid. Cairn paths split at unmarked junctions: white stones left, black stones right, locals never explain which is safe. Cracked-open tombs with scattered grave goods. Scavenger camps full of nervous armed men stripping ruins for coin — the Blacktooth Orcs despise them. Runic warning stones carved with screaming faces. Abandoned mine entrances where rope dangles into darkness and echoes suggest vast spaces below. The Khuzduk Hills are beautiful and haunted, and the deeper you go the older the ruins get and the less anything makes sense.

KHUZDUK PEAKS
Weathered mountains above the hills, ancient beyond reckoning. The air thins. Scree fields shift underfoot. Glaciers. Hidden cults. Ruins, massive stone doors standing ajar, wind howling out carrying the smell of old incense. Dragon sign — claw marks in rock, scales in crevices, sulphur stench. Beneath all of it: tremors. Rhythmic. Stone against stone, as if something were trying to open a door. The Khuzduk Remnant-Wardens — twenty dwarves under Thordak Ironbrow — guard the deep wards and the Dwarven Aqueduct that connects the Peaks to Khuzdukan. Thoron invoked the Kh'a'Vash here and swore to return. The mountains remember that oath, even if the man who swore it hasn't kept it yet.

KHUZDUKAN
The ruined dwarven citadel. Once the heart of the Khuzduk nation, now a shell — contested, abandoned, haunted by legacy and by things less metaphorical. Tomb raiders pick through the upper halls. Dwarven ghosts walk in ancient armour and vanish when approached. Runic traps still fire. Collapse is constant — the architecture remembers its purpose but the stone is tired. Deep entrances open onto stairs that descend into darkness with fresh air rising, meaning something opened them recently. Hammering echoes from below — rhythmic, relentless, never stopping. Pockets of dwarven survivors endure in the deeper halls, fiercely resilient, trust earned not given. The Dwarven Gate from the Khuzduk Hills is the only surface entry; the Dwarven Aqueduct connects to the Peaks. Khuzdukan is a legacy power site with unresolved risk, and whatever stirs beneath the Peaks is closer to Khuzdukan than to anything else.

NARROWS
Grassy uplands squeezed between the Riverlands and the lethal boundary of Highfell Forest. The Narrows feel open but they aren't — the forest looms on one side, and shapes move at its edge that are never quite visible. Cairn lines mark the boundary; locals never cross them. The Pathwardens maintain the cairn line and guide travelers for coin, tolerated by the elves on terms nobody has written down. Dael Urrwood guids here, soft-spoken and cautious, paid in silver. The old Elven road runs west to the Riverlands. Havar's Bridge crosses south to Vargol's Reach. Amon's Gully climbs northwest to the Western Scarps. Everything passes through the Narrows, and the elves watch all of it.

OUTER WETLANDS
Waterways, hillocks, pine trees, ravens. The Outer Wetlands lie east of the Floodplain, fed by the River of Stone, and they are the first place where the land stops making normal sense. Eerie sounds carry across still water. Mist sits in hollows that should be dry. Ravens perch in numbers that suggest intelligence rather than hunger. The Wetlands are not yet dangerous in the way the Floodplain is dangerous, but they are the threshold — the place where Gammaria's settled world gives way to something older and less interested in human borders.

RIVER OF BIRDS
The river delta where the River of Skulls meets the Sea of Birds, a lowland of rushes and reeds and extraordinary birdlife. Herons, egrets, kingfishers, cormorants — and things that look like birds but aren't, not quite, not if you watch them long enough. The main canal runs to Fort Seawatch. The towpath follows the River of Skulls north to the Riverlands. Flat-bottomed barges move cargo through channels barely wide enough, bargemen poling in silence. The river is slow here. The reeds whisper. The birds watch.

RIVERLANDS
The confluence of the River Koss and the River of Skulls — Gammaria's busiest inland waterway. Here, traffic comes through the mountain locks to and from Imperial Torlec. Barges, ferries, towpath traffic, merchants arguing over right of passage. The Grand Lock connects south to Riverwatch. The old Elven road runs northeast to the Narrows. Tundra trails lead south to Vargol's Reach. Widow Hassal bakes bread and sells gossip at the confluence waystation. Torva Selk runs barge traffic and avoids trouble. Bargemen refuse to travel the River of Skulls at night since the patrol disappeared — four men, barge found drifting empty, oars still shipped, no blood, no bodies. The Riverlands are the connective tissue of Gammaria, and when they go quiet, something is wrong.

RIVERWATCH
Gammaria's customs outpost at the confluence, where the Grand Lock controls everything that moves by water. Castellan Harren Vael runs it with bureaucratic precision — well-dressed, manicured, efficient. Cleaner than Caras, calmer than Seawatch. Blacktooth Orc traders barter with nomads, loud but good-natured. River lock disputes are routine. Smugglers get caught; crowds gather for the trial. What's less routine: certain merchant vessels pass inspection too fast. Clerks cite "priority clearance." Identical clearance stamps have appeared across multiple clerks — forgery or shared credentials. Vael is compiling evidence and considering escalation. Beneath the orderly surface, something is being moved through Riverwatch that shouldn't be, and the stamps are the first thread. Completed Reapmere 5th, 14503 — built alongside Fort Seawatch to control the river trade that Thoron knew would be Gammaria's lifeblood.

SEA OF BIRDS
Gammaria's inland sea, vast and wrong. Birds flock the shores in colonies that shift and scream. The water is deep and dark and things live in it that are older than the kingdom and older than the continent. Leviathans surface and capsize small craft. Storms strike without warning. The drowned dead rise — ghouled corpses clawing at hull or shore. Pirates work the open water. Sea-mist brings madness — thick fog, voices, direction lost. And at the worst of it: kraken sign. The God of the Deep wakes. Fisher's Beach fronts it to the west, the Southern Shore to the south, Seawatch Ramparts to the east. The Sea of Birds is beautiful from a distance. Up close it is a horror.

SEAWATCH RAMPARTS
The defensive bulwarks and trade districts surrounding Fort Seawatch. Docks, warehouses, taverns, the sea wall. Brawls between sailors and merchants are nightly entertainment. Press-gangs recruit "volunteers." Customs officials run shakedowns. Warehouse fires may or may not be arson. Public executions happen at the dock's edge — pirates and smugglers, hanged as warning. Covert meetings in back rooms — whispers of ancient powers, arcane tattoos glimpsed, the Dead Gods of Krovekëa hunger. And occasionally, high above the ramparts, a white shape circles — young dragon Soreth, curious, unafraid. Few know what he is. Fewer know whose he is.

SIGHING SWAMPS
The marshland south of Vornost, where rushes whisper and strange birds call from reed beds that shouldn't be deep enough to hold them. Vornost looms above, its shadow falling across the black water. The low stairs connect the swamps to the fortress — the entrance you use when you don't want to be seen. Marsh gas ignites without warning. Bone-reed thickets grow from old battlefields; disturbing them wakes restless spirits. Sinking ground swallows the unwary. Fever-mist rolls in yellow and stinking, and the voices in it aren't the wind. A corpse-willow grove hangs with what looks like rags until you look closer — bodies, old, Vornost garrison tabards rotted through. Deserters or traitors. Message without words. The Sighing Swamps are Gammaria's back door, and everything that comes through them is either desperate or dangerous.

SOUTHERN SCARPS
Gorse moors and heather, birds of prey wheeling overhead. The Southern Scarps sit between the East March and Furdach Forest, overlooking the wilderness to the south. Quieter than the Eastern or Western Scarps — no wyverns, no dimensional instability, no Edhellar. But not safe. Raptor nests hold giant hawks and eagles that defend territory with lethal enthusiasm. Ancient battlefields lie beneath the heather — bones and rusted swords, and at dusk, faint music that is sorrow, not menace. Standing stones with fresh offerings. Wildfire scars where moorland burned deliberately. And hunters found dead with their throats torn out, killed by something that walks upright. The Southern Scarps are the overlooked middle ground, and that makes them the perfect place for things that don't want to be noticed.

SOUTHERN SHORE
Stony beaches, driftwood, the smell of salt and rot. Weird things wash up on the Southern Shore — strange idols with tentacled forms whose eyes follow you, slaver skiffs with broken oars and empty chains, dead fish by the thousand. The sea is waiting. A broken woodland leads inland toward the Gloatburrow Hills, which means anything moving along this coast is caught between the goblin hills and whatever lives in the water. A hermit's driftwood shack houses a prophet or a cultist — wisdom and madness look the same this far south. At low tide, a stone circle emerges from the surf, carved with warnings in a script no one can read. The water rises fast. Those who linger learn something they should not have.

TEMPLE OF THE SUN
Completed Fasting 15th, 14503 — the first structure Thoron built in Gammaria, and the one that may destroy it from within. The Temple sits on the Scarps between the Pilgrim's Walk from the east and the Penitent's Way from the west, and it has become a doctrinal crucible. Ush'n'Elthar and Ush'n'Taalgith clash over theology. Sundancer Dervishes face heresy trials. Tension climbs with every day no authority intervenes. Factions harden. Prophets draw crowds. Blood has been spilled on sacred stone. The Temple is Gammaria's spiritual heart, and its spiritual heart is at war with itself.

VALLANDOR MOUNTAINS
Impassable peaks forming Gammaria's western border with Imperial Torlec. House Vallandor patrols these mountains, and they are not kind. Armoured riders challenge travelers — produce papers or die. Frozen corpses on the trail are warnings, not casualties. Border forts fly the Vallandor banner. Empty cages hang from cliffs — the message is clear even without current victims. Lord Talgar Vallandor is feared and hated, and his name is the reason Gammaria exists behind these mountains rather than in front of them. The only safe passage is through Whiteagle Keep. Everything else is avalanche, ambush, and dragon lairs.

VARGOL'S REACH
Southern tundra, vast and cold. Wolves roam in coordinated packs — worgs, Gammarian-bred, descendants of the packs Thoron and Pony befriended during the founding. They hunt anything that moves and they're better at it than you. Dragons pass overhead. Tundra trails connect to the Riverlands; Havar's Bridge crosses to the Narrows; a low pass leads to the Gloatburrow Hills; Drummer's Bridge reaches the Hinterlands. And at the far end of the Reach, the steep slope climbs to the Vallandor Mountains and Glaurung's Gate opens onto Whiteagle Keep. This is the long way round — the southern road to the border — and everything out here is either hunting or being hunted.

VORNOST
The Black Fortress. Seat of the Helkar. The Dragon Throne. Thoron cleared the great rock pillar on Evernew 9th, 14501 — Lithoe killed a family of giant lizards with Fireball so they could build on it — and Vornost was completed Grismere 19th, 14503, the last and greatest structure of the founding. It dominates the Sighing Swamps physically and symbolically. The low stairs descend into the marsh. Dragon-Skull Gate opens onto the Grey Plains — and it remains closed to Thoron until all five companions have rejoined him and they ride through together. Castellan Joppa holds it, trim and officious, preparing the Black Fortress for a return he's confirmed from a patrol report. Kael Dravorn and the commandos wait for orders. Vornost is the endgame — the seat of power Thoron built and cannot yet enter.

WESTERN SCARPS
Rugged highlands northwest of Fort Amon, riddled with Edhellar ruins and dimensional instability. The sky shifts colour. The ground tilts. Voices speak in reverse. Sundancer Dervishes mark safe paths through the distortion — the Penitent's Way Wardens, a splinter-group of pilgrims who consider this dangerous work a form of devotion. Corrupted Edhellar watch from ridgelines — warped elf-shapes, ancient and wrong, phasing in and out of reality. Old Maren grazes her sheep here and shrugs: "they only kill if you run." Stone circles hum at frequencies that cause headaches. Travelers die without wounds, expressions of terror on intact faces. The Western Scarps are where Gammaria's reality frays.

WHITEAGLE KEEP
The border fortress in the Vallandor Mountains, guarding the chief pass between Gammaria and Imperial Torlec. This is where the clearing expedition began — Evernew 3rd, 14501, Thoron and his companions walked out of Whiteagle Keep and into the wilderness that would become their kingdom. Tirris Vargol holds it now. An elf. Patient. Iron-masked. He was granted the Keep and made Tirris — and in the eight years since Thoron vanished, he has been quietly positioning himself as successor. His Ironmask Council operates from here, and an agent has been dispatched to Caras to assess Conorth. Glaurungoriel roosts above the fortress. Torlec envoys request parley at the gate. Spies are suspected. Deserters flee toward Torlec lines. Whiteagle Keep is where Gammaria began, and it may be where Gammaria's internal war for succession is decided.
