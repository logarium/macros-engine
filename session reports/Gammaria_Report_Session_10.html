<h2 id='summaries'>Session Summaries</h2>
<h3>Session 0</h3>
<div class='summary-block'>Thoron returns after years away (retrieved Armour of Ice from cyber-lich across planes). Gammaria grown from forts to young nation. Companions scattered; citizens don&#x27;t recognize face (title &quot;Helkar&quot; known, person forgotten). Must find companions, reclaim authority through action. Arrives Gammaria with Crandurth (skull-hilted sword) and Icemane (black warhorse, white mane) steed.</div>
<h3>Session 1</h3>
<div class='summary-block'>Thoron spawned in Eastern Scarps, descended to Scarp Watch Station. Met Warden Kellis and Scout Aedrin (patrol station). Performed founder&#x27;s handshake instinctively, revealed knowledge of Altan Tepes campaign and original Gammarian commandos. Investigated wyvern matriarch nest; identified Corrupted Edhellar kill (hoarfrost patterns, surgical throat wound, dimensional cold signature, barefoot humanoid tracks). Returned to station, revealed identity publicly: &quot;Tell them the Helkar has returned... Tell them Thoron is back.&quot; Ravens dispatched to Vornost confirming Thoron&#x27;s return and Edhellar threat. Rode south via good road (2 days). Encountered wyvern nest with circling mother during descent. Arrived Grey Plains; met Captain Rendal&#x27;s patrol and Free Hope caravan. Discussed Caras situation and Riverwatch option. Session ended mid-conversation with Captain Rendal.</div>
<h3>Session 2</h3>
<div class='summary-block'>Thoron traveled from Grey Plains to Riverwatch via River Koss Ferry (1 day). Arrived late afternoon 4th Ilrym. Observed Father Lalholm conducting Haadis death-rites at the waterfront. Approached Lalholm with founding-era recognition phrase (&quot;a man could catch his death standing out here in this cold&quot;). Lalholm recognized Thoron instantly. Emotional reunion: Lalholm vindicated in faith that Thoron would return; expressed years of frustration maintaining kingdom during absence. Thoron revealed planar imprisonment as cause of absence. Shared intelligence about Corrupted Edhellar active in Eastern Scarps (existential threat). Declared plan: gather all companions, ride for Vornost, reclaim Dragon Throne. Lalholm rejoined party immediately. Discussed route options to Fort Vanguard (seeking Suzanne and Lithoe): Caras route (3 days, political exposure) vs Scarp route (4 days, wilderness). Session ended with route decision pending and Lalholm ready to depart immediately.</div>
<h3>Session 3</h3>
<div class='summary-block'>Thoron and Father Lalholm departed Riverwatch at dusk on the 4th of Ilrym, avoiding Caras to protect Valania&#x27;s deep cover and avoid Conorth&#x27;s attention. Traveled overland through the Riverlands confluence (heard reports of missing Gammarian river patrol, UA-04), the Narrows (guided by Dael Urrwood past elven cairn line, horn-calls increasing, UA-05), the Western Scarps (dimensional instability worsening near Edhellar ruins, Sundancer pilgrim-warrior Sereth Kale marking safe paths, Old Maren reported Corrupted Edhellar sighting on ridgeline), and across Amon&#x27;s Causeway into the Eastern Scarps (wyvern territorial combat observed, Pilgrim Ossar walking sacred circuit undeterred). Descended via poor road into Grey Plains where a Gammarian patrol checkpoint refused entry without papers — sergeant laughed off any claim to be the Helkar (&quot;that&#x27;s the third this month&quot;). Helped farmer Wellen repair broken cart and salvage grain on the road — displayed extraordinary strength; children fascinated by Crandurth&#x27;s horned skull hilt. Took dwarf trail east into Khuzduk Hills where a dead traveler with torn throat and drag marks confirmed unknown predator activity (UA-07). Climbed cairn path to Khuzduk Peaks where Thoron invoked the Kh&#x27;a&#x27;Vash — the Silence of Stone — a blood-pact between his line and the Khuzduk dwarves dating to the Year Before Founding. Thordak Ironbrow, grandson of Krenn who walked with the Founders, accepted the invocation (palm-to-fist binding gesture completed). Thoron swore an additional oath: when the Six Founders are reunited and Dragon-Skull Gate opened, he will ride for Khuzdukan to investigate what stirs beneath the peaks (deep tremors, grinding sounds, deep ward referenced in ancient inscriptions). Agna Stonecradle provided path-marks for the Dwarven Aqueduct. Descended Dwarven Steps into East March where Sergeant Durn&#x27;s patrol intercepted them coming down from the peaks. Session ended with Thoron and Lalholm in the East March, one day from Fort Vanguard, where Henric Bale has just publicly confronted Suzanne over patrol doctrine.</div>
<h3>Session 4</h3>
<div class='summary-block'>Thoron and Father Lalholm, escorted by Sergeant Durn&#x27;s patrol, traveled the Old East Road from the East March to Fort Vanguard on the 13th of Ilrym. Thoron arrived at the fort and was recognized by Suzanne of Corlaine, who embraced him fiercely in the yard before the entire garrison. Thoron publicly declared himself Helkar, acknowledged he must prove his identity, and demanded accountability. He charged Castellan Vasha with failure — failure to command, failure to intervene in the Bale crisis, failure to protect her soldiers — and sentenced her to death. Suzanne of Corlaine executed Vasha with Yor-Kazh in the officers&#x27; hall before all senior officers. Thoron appointed Henric Bale as the new Castellan of Fort Vanguard and promoted Hadrien Voss to Patrol Commander, with Selde Marr as adjutant and Arvek Morn steadying the enlisted ranks. Lalholm blessed the soul and provided counsel throughout, advocating for public justice over covert killing, and suggesting the Bale/Voss dual-command structure. Following the execution and appointments, Thoron walked the killing ground with Suzanne in private. She disclosed the depth of Orcus&#x27;s hold on her — the hunger, the whispers, the erosion of will. Thoron, in turn, revealed his own history with Ringur, the soul-drinking sword — his years as Morgil &quot;Dark Star&quot;, the killing of friends and companions while possessed, and his eventual banishment of Ringur into the Well of Time. He also revealed that Tirris Vargol once bore Ringur, raising the terrifying possibility that Vargol may recall or already possess the sword. Suzanne pledged silence on the Ringur/Morgil secret. Suzanne also briefed Thoron on the eastern approaches threat: recurring inhuman tracks (UA-09), a persistent rhythmic sound from the east after dark, and a ritualistic animal kill-site (deer dismantled and organs arranged deliberately). Thoron plans to ride at dawn to find Lithoe, then gather remaining companions and ride for Vornost.</div>
<h3>Session 5</h3>
<div class='summary-block'>Thoron departed Fort Vanguard at dawn on the 14th of Ilrym with Suzanne and Lalholm, leaving Castellan Bale in command. Three days&#x27; travel through East March, Khuzduk Peaks, and the Dwarven Aqueduct brought them to Khuzdukan on the 16th, guided by Thordak Ironbrow. Along the route: Corporal Edda Wynne&#x27;s checkpoint confirmed patrol operations; Drover Tomas Fell reported livestock vanishing without remains; an unsealed ruin was discovered in the Peaks; Warden Durik Ashpick reported two wardens (Grull and Torvash) missing after being sent to investigate the deep ward-chamber three days prior. The Wyvern Territory Dispute reached critical — Eastern Scarps travel now requires escort. At Khuzdukan, Lithoe Wano-Kan was found in the deep halls. Thoron approached her with respect for her expertise rather than commands, following Suzanne&#x27;s counsel. Lithoe shared six weeks of research: the deep ward is pre-Khuzdukan precursor binding architecture; rune-sequences are being rewritten from beneath by something that understands the binding language better than its builders; the rewrite boundary is expanding concentrically. The party descended to the ward-chamber. The central inscriptions were actively shifting in the stone. The rewrite boundary had expanded from the central circle to the chamber walls in three days. Wardens Grull and Torvash were found alive but soul-suspended within the active field — breathing, eyes open, unseeing. Thoron crossed the rewrite boundary, resisted the binding field&#x27;s holding effect, and carried both wardens out. He experienced direct contact with the bound entity: vast, patient, malignant, old beyond reckoning, aware of his presence, pleased by it. Lalholm assessed the wardens as held, not dead — souls preserved, not consumed. He reported that Haadis considers the entity a rival, which is rare. Lithoe estimated the ward will fail completely in two weeks or less. The party discussed strategic options: Lithoe stays to map counter-sequences; companions must be gathered; the kingdom is fraying on multiple fronts. Thoron spoke to Suzanne privately through expression alone, protecting her Orcus secret, then declared to the group: &quot;Suzanne&#x27;s burden is my burden. As is Lithoe&#x27;s. As is yours. That is what it means to be Helkar.&quot;</div>
<h3>Session 6</h3>
<div class='summary-block'>Thoron departed Khuzdukan at dawn on the 17th of Ilrym with Suzanne, leaving Lalholm and Lithoe behind to work on counter-sequences and warden recovery. Four days&#x27; travel through Khuzduk Hills, Grey Plains, Hinterlands, and Seawatch Ramparts brought them to Fort Seawatch on the 20th. Along the route: a dead traveler with torn throat confirmed continued predator activity in the Hills; a Caras military courier bearing Conorth&#x27;s seal was observed riding east at speed; Suzanne disclosed that Yor-Kazh had been &quot;resonating&quot; in Khuzdukan&#x27;s deep halls — not singing but vibrating with recognition, as if greeting kin. She assessed the entity beneath the mountains and the thing inside Yor-Kazh as related but not identical, warning that if the ward breaks, Yor-Kazh will answer. At Seawatch Ramparts, the young white dragon Soreth was sighted circling the fort, curious and unafraid, before departing south. News of the Temple of the Sun schism reached the Ramparts — the doctrinal fracture between Ush&#x27;n&#x27;Elthar and Ush&#x27;n&#x27;Taalgith had become irreversible, with fistfights in the nave and pilgrims choosing sides. Thoron reunited with Guldur Emeldyr at a dockside tavern in Fort Seawatch on the 21st. The reunion was fierce and genuine — Guldur&#x27;s mask dropped for one heartbeat before the humour returned. Thoron told him everything: the betrayal, the Plane of Fire, Dragon Mountain, the return, Gammaria&#x27;s fractures, and the entity beneath Khuzdukan. Guldur briefed Thoron on Seawatch&#x27;s problems: Castellan Merrow Kest stretched thin; a Torlec vessel that refused inspection anchored in the bay for four days with no contact; Golden Hind smuggling with the same customs stamp anomaly seen at Riverwatch; and an active Cult of Orcus cell in the ossuaries beneath the old harbour. Thoron, Suzanne, and Guldur descended into the ossuaries via the old chandlery on Saltgate. They found the communion chamber — a nine-point invocation circle with layered candle wax, bone resonance amplifiers, and a skull receiver. Suzanne identified it as Corlaine-school seminary-level liturgical work: a handler-directed communion rite, not summoning, used within the last ten days. Yor-Kazh hummed in the chamber — same resonance as Khuzdukan. Suzanne warned that every Orcus communion circle becomes a door the entity can knock on if the ward fails. The party returned to the surface and departed for Riverwatch via the River of Skulls Ferry on the 22nd, heading for Caras and Valania — the last companion.</div>
<h3>Session 7</h3>
<div class='summary-block'>Thoron, Suzanne, and Guldur departed Riverwatch on the morning of the 23rd of Ilrym, taking the River Koss Ferry north to Caras. The ferry arrived at midmorning. Caras was thick with Conorth&#x27;s soldiers — gate inspections heavier than Thoron remembered, younger troops, Conorth&#x27;s colours on the gatehouse. The party entered through the river gate without drawing attention; the Helkar remains a title in Caras, not a face. The three discussed how to find Valania, who was deep cover in the Golden Hind merchant networks beneath the city. Three approaches existed: trigger Hidden Temple contact in the underlayers, infiltrate Golden Hind operations directly, or invoke the covert recognition signals Valania had established during the founding. Guldur proposed using Suzanne&#x27;s Orcus liturgical knowledge as bait to attract Hidden Temple attention — they hunt demons, and someone who could speak about communion architecture with professional fluency would draw them out. Thoron refused. &quot;She isn&#x27;t bait. Not even for Valania.&quot; The moment landed — Suzanne heard it, Guldur filed it permanently. They chose speed over caution. Thoron and Guldur descended into the Caras underlayers through the tanner&#x27;s yard stairs on Millhook Street — stairs Thoron watched masons cut twenty years ago. Suzanne remained topside to secure lodgings. In the underlayer merchant sub-level, Thoron found two of Valania&#x27;s founding-era recognition signals still maintained: a coin pressed into a mortar seam and a knotted cord on a wall-nail. He adjusted both — &quot;I am here. Come to me. Urgent. Personal.&quot; Valania arrived within the hour. The reunion was fierce and raw. She came around the corner with knives drawn, saw Thoron, and stopped. Three years of deep cover broke on two words: &quot;You bastard. You came back.&quot; Guldur withdrew to give them space. Thoron told her everything — not the factual briefing he gave Guldur, but the emotional weight: the betrayal, the Plane of Fire, Dragon Mountain, coming home to Edhellar in Gammaria, the entity beneath Khuzdukan, Suzanne&#x27;s sword. He told her he had seen Soreth alive at Seawatch Ramparts. That hit hardest. Then he told her he had shared the Ringur secret with Suzanne. Valania&#x27;s fury was controlled, precise, and professional — the spymistress recalculating her entire network with a new variable. She did not break. She said: &quot;When this is over, you and I are going to talk about what trust means when it comes to the woman carrying a sword that serves Orcus.&quot; The party assembled at a rented room above a saddler&#x27;s shop. Valania and Suzanne occupied the same space for the first time — Gardurth and Yor-Kazh six feet apart, the sister-swords of two women who share a man&#x27;s trust and nothing else. Valania took command of logistics: ride at dawn, Grey Gate, south through the Plains, east to Khuzdukan. Three days if they push. Guldur went to find horses. The session ended with the party preparing to depart Caras at first light, heading for Khuzdukan and whatever waits beneath the mountains.</div>
<h3>Session 8</h3>
<div class='summary-block'>Thoron and his five companions departed Caras at dawn on the 24th of Ilrym, riding south through the Grey Gate toward Khuzdukan. The three-day journey took them across the Grey Plains, through the Khuzduk Hills, and finally to the Dwarven Gate of Khuzdukan itself. Valania commanded the logistics; the party pushed hard. The Grey Plains crossing was uneventful — a caravan convergence at a ford, merchant wine shared, road-camaraderie. The tension was internal: Valania and Suzanne maintained a controlled silence across six feet of hostility, Guldur worked as social buffer, and Thoron held the centre. On the second day through the Khuzduk Hills, a Grey Plains patrol was sighted moving perpendicular — disciplined troops, plain insignia, no acknowledgment. The dwarf trail ascent brought them to a hilltop ruin smoking at dusk without visible fire. On the third day they rode hard through the Dwarven Gate. At Khuzdukan, Kelda Firebrand lowered her crossbow at the aqueduct terminus. Thordak met them in the upper halls: &quot;She found it. Two days ago. She can slow the breaking. Maybe stop it. She needs you to do it.&quot; The hammering from below was louder than Session 5 — patient, relentless, closer. Yor-Kazh trembled visibly in Suzanne&#x27;s grip. The party descended to Lithoe&#x27;s research chamber in the deep halls. Lithoe had identified a viable counter-sequence during the party&#x27;s absence, working two days without sleep. The counter-sequence required someone to enter the active binding field and hold position at the central inscription while Lithoe worked the sequence from outside. The entity was aware and hostile — no longer curious as in Session 5. Lalholm would anchor the theological component through Haadis&#x27;s opposition. The risk: Thoron&#x27;s soul. If the entity took hold permanently, Lalholm could not retrieve it. Permanent loss. Thoron declared himself the Hand of Gramlar and walked into the runes. The entity seized him immediately — his saving throw failed against the expanded, strengthened field. It poured visions of Gammaria burning, every Orcus circle becoming a door, Suzanne opening like a flower. Thoron defied it directly, taunting its hidden nature — calling it afraid, naming it an impostor using Orcus&#x27;s doors. The entity flinched. For one instant Thoron glimpsed its true shape: vast, coiled, luminous, and terrified — pressing against the binding architecture not to break free but to hide from something on the other side. Then it struck back in fury. But Lithoe&#x27;s counter-sequence locked into the central inscription, Lalholm drove the theological anchor home, and the entity released its grip. The runes went still. The hammering stopped. The rewrite is frozen — not reversed, but stopped. Weeks, perhaps months, purchased. Suzanne held against Yor-Kazh&#x27;s call throughout, though the blade answered the entity the entire time.</div>
<h3>Session 9</h3>
<div class='summary-block'>Thoron checked on Lithoe immediately after the counter-sequence — she was collapsed among charcoal diagrams, two days without sleep. She deflected concern but noted that Thoron had seen something when the entity flinched. Thoron moved the party to an upper gallery for camp, old dungeoneering habits from the crypts of Tallak. He addressed the group by firelight, acknowledged his long absence, pledged amends.

Thoron asked Valania to walk with him privately. The deferred Ringur confrontation occurred on a moonlit balcony. Valania challenged why he disclosed Ringur and Morgil to Suzanne — why share with a stranger what Valania kept for three years? Thoron held his ground: the disclosure was necessary because Suzanne&#x27;s enslavement to Yor-Kazh mirrors his Ringur corruption. He spoke Suzix&#x27;s name aloud for the first time. The deeper revelation: Suzanne reminds him not of Suzix but of Morgil — his own corrupted self. Valania accepted with one non-negotiable condition: if saving Suzanne ever means losing Thoron or losing Gammaria, she will choose Thoron without hesitation. Walking back to camp, Thoron disclosed the entity&#x27;s true nature to Valania privately — luminous, serpentine, afraid, hiding from something external. Valania grasped the strategic implications immediately: a frightened enemy can be negotiated with or manipulated.

Thoron briefed the full party on the entity vision. Lithoe assessed the counter-sequence bought weeks, possibly two months. She cannot reverse the fourteen of sixteen altered rune-sequences. She needs Lalholm&#x27;s theological support. Suzanne provided critical intelligence: communion circles are receivers the entity uses in reverse as broadcast infrastructure. Every circle becomes an open door if the binding breaks. Yor-Kazh was &quot;happy&quot; during the counter-sequence, trying to sing in response to the entity&#x27;s call. Suzanne held it down through force of will.

Valania proposed splitting the party three ways: Lithoe and Lalholm remain at Khuzdukan; Suzanne and Guldur ride to Fort Seawatch to destroy the communion circle; Thoron and Valania ride for Vornost via the Dragon-Skull Gate. Thoron ordered Lithoe to build an arcane sending network before the split. The evening ended with Thoron and Guldur drinking terrible wine by firelight. Guldur told stories. Lalholm joined for two cups. Lithoe fell asleep against a wall; Guldur draped his cloak over her. Suzanne drank alone but listened, Yor-Kazh placed out of arm&#x27;s reach for the first time.

Morning of the 27th: Thoron&#x27;s farewell speech. &quot;We accomplished something astounding by being together again. Last time we felled a kingdom and made one. This time we&#x27;re saving one.&quot; To Suzanne directly: &quot;We&#x27;re going to save each other.&quot; Lithoe handed resonance anchor tablets to Thoron and Guldur. Lalholm said: &quot;We&#x27;ll hold the binding. Go take your throne.&quot; The party departed via the Dwarven Gate.</div>
<h3>Session 10</h3>
<div class='summary-block'>Session 10 opened on the Grey Plains, 28 Ilrym, with Thoron and Valania riding toward Vornost. The two shared a quiet moment recalling their first night in the tower at Vornost — foundations laid in more than stone. Valania counselled stealth over ceremony: with four companions still in Khuzduk territory, the Dragon-Skull Gate was closed to them. The three-way split she proposed last session meant they rode alone.

Thoron accepted the logic. They took the boggy track into the Sighing Swamps. En route, Time and Pressure advanced the world one day to 29 Ilrym. The Binding Degradation clock ticked to 15/16 — one increment from catastrophe. The Demon Ledger advanced to 6/8. The Enigma Crystal Hunt reached 8/14. Vanguard Patrol Doctrine reported ambiguous contact on the eastern perimeter.

In the Sighing Swamps, the pair discovered a corpse-willow grove hung with bodies — three men in rotted Vornost garrison tabards, throats cut, strung up with military knots. Deserters or men called deserters. Thoron cut them down and buried them in the black earth. &quot;A Helkar is made in the soil of his land.&quot;

They entered Vornost via the low stairs — the back entrance, the thief&#x27;s door. This triggered the Sneaking Consequences: creation of the Vornost Legitimacy Crisis clock (0/6), halting of all Recognition clocks, withdrawal of Church of Haadis support, Conorth publicly questioning Thoron&#x27;s identity, Golden Hind ignoring trade restrictions, and Ironmask Council exploitation.

Castellan Joppa received them with controlled fury. He had prepared the Dragon-Skull Gate, drilled ceremonial formations, briefed officers — and Thoron came up the swamp stairs. He laid out the political damage plainly. Valania read a letter from Vargol formally claiming stewardship and requesting Conorth recognise him as regent.

Something shifted in Thoron. He reversed his own strategy — abandoning the three-way split in favour of an immediate recall of all companions to Vornost. He declared he would give Gammaria the Helkar it needed. Joppa committed to preparing the fortress. Valania began drafting the recall. Estimated timeline: three to four days for all companions to converge. The Dragon-Skull Gate ceremony would follow.

Session ended with Thoron standing at the window of the Black Fortress, looking out over a kingdom that didn&#x27;t yet know its king had come home.</div>

<h2 id='divine'>Divine / Metaphysical Consequences</h2>
<h3>Orcus</h3>
<div class='section'>
<b>Intervention:</b> Yor-Kazh fed during Vasha&#x27;s execution (S4); humming in deep halls near ward-chamber (S5); resonated in Orcus communion chamber at Fort Seawatch (S6) — same frequency as Khuzdukan response; S8: Yor-Kazh answered entity&#x27;s call during counter-sequence — blazed black, actively responded; Suzanne held; entity confirmed NOT Orcus-aligned but using Orcus doors opportunistically<br>
<b>Cost Incurred:</b> Suzanne&#x27;s resistance tested at highest level yet; Yor-Kazh actively responded to entity kin; &quot;This time&quot; implies future resistance uncertain; entity&#x27;s use of Orcus doors confirmed — communion circles remain vulnerability<br>
<b>Lingering Effects:</b> Yor-Kazh now silent (post-counter-sequence; sheathed); entity-Orcus door mechanism confirmed; communion cell at Fort Seawatch still active; every Orcus circle remains a potential door; Hidden Temple sanctioned cell dispatched — may intersect with Orcus activity<br>
<b>Visibility:</b> Yor-Kazh blazing witnessed by all six (S8); kinship — secret (Thoron, Suzanne); communion cell — restricted (Thoron, Suzanne, Guldur)<br>
</div>
<h3>Haadis</h3>
<div class='section'>
<b>Intervention:</b> Lalholm&#x27;s surface communion (19th Ilrym) — Haadis confirmed entity holds wardens&#x27; souls through binding architecture, not independent power; cannot reclaim what another power grips; recovery requires severing rune-chains; S8: Lalholm anchored counter-sequence theological component through Haadis&#x27;s opposition — divine power actively opposed entity&#x27;s architectural claim; Lalholm bled from effort<br>
<b>Cost Incurred:</b> Haadis&#x27;s limitations revealed (cannot override entity&#x27;s architectural grip); divine obligation on Lalholm continues; physical cost to Lalholm (nosebleed); Haadis&#x27;s opposition to entity confirmed as functional mechanism<br>
<b>Lingering Effects:</b> Haadis attending to bound entity; considers it a rival; wardens&#x27; soul-suspension is jurisdictional violation; counter-sequence anchored through Haadis&#x27;s power — ongoing theological investment; rune-chain severance for warden recovery now feasible<br>
<b>Visibility:</b> restricted (Lalholm, Lithoe, Thordak; wider party witnessed Lalholm&#x27;s effort during counter-sequence)<br>
</div>
<h3>Gramlar</h3>
<div class='section'>
<b>Intervention:</b> Thoron invoked Gramlar before entering binding field — &quot;I am the Hand of Gramlar. I am not afraid.&quot;; no direct divine intervention observed; Thoron&#x27;s defiance may draw on Gramlar&#x27;s price (Well of Time: Gramlar demanded Thoron become true warrior, cunning, powerful in belief)<br>
<b>Cost Incurred:</b> (none observed — invocation only)<br>
<b>Lingering Effects:</b> Gramlar&#x27;s name spoken in entity&#x27;s presence; Thoron&#x27;s identity as Hand of Gramlar asserted against bound entity; entity now aware of Thoron&#x27;s divine patron<br>
<b>Visibility:</b> public (spoken aloud; all party members heard)<br>
</div>
<h3>Entity (Children of Dead Gods)</h3>
<div class='section'>
<b>Intervention:</b> Entity flinched during counter-sequence — revealed true form (luminous, serpentine, afraid). Not trying to escape but hiding from something external.<br>
<b>Cost Incurred:</b> Counter-sequence froze degradation but did not reverse it. 14/16 rune-sequences remain altered.<br>
<b>Lingering Effects:</b> Entity will probe binding for weaknesses. Yor-Kazh resonated with entity call. Communion circles serve as broadcast infrastructure.<br>
<b>Visibility:</b> Party briefed on vision; full strategic implications known to Valania<br>
