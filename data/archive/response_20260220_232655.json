Caras agent reorders received \u2014 full intelligence profile on Conorth, Golden Hind leadership, and Conorth's secretary. Valania estimates 3 days for Khuzdukan group, 4 for Seawatch pair.\n\n2. Suzanne of Corlaine (Khuzduk Hills \u2192 en route to Fort Seawatch): Departed Khuzdukan with Guldur via the Dwarven Bridge. Yor-Kazh strapped to her back, silent for now. She sets a hard pace. Guldur keeps up but complains about the terrain.\n\n3. Lithoe Wano-Kan (Khuzdukan): Began resonance calibration tests for arcane sending network. Initial results unstable \u2014 the counter-sequence is interfering with signal propagation. Needs to isolate frequencies. Notes anomalous harmonic she cannot explain.\n\n4. Kael Dravorn (Vornost): Began quiet investigation of swamp hangings. Examined ropework from corpse-willow grove \u2014 confirmed old commando knots, pre-founding vintage. Narrowed to original cadre veterans. Three candidates identified, all still serving. Has not yet interrogated.\n\n5. Henric Bale (Fort Vanguard): Received Valania's recall rider. Confused \u2014 orders reference companion convergence at Vornost but Bale has no companion to send. Forwarded intelligence packet to Thoron via same rider: eastern perimeter contact patterns suggest coordinated probing, not random incursion.\n\n6. Harren Vael (Riverwatch): Still awaiting Caras response on customs anomaly evidence. Growing nervous. Began keeping duplicate records in case originals 'disappear' on Conorth's desk.",
