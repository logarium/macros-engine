      "content": "The recall letters are spread across the table like a small battlefield \u2014 ink still wet on three of them, Valania's hand precise as a surgeon's. She's seated in the window alcove of your quarters, legs drawn beneath her, quill moving without pause. The candlelight catches the line of her jaw, the dark fall of her hair, the pointed ear half-hidden beneath it.\n\nYou move behind her. Your hand settles on her shoulder \u2014 warm skin beneath thin linen. The quill stops.\n\n'Don't,' she says, but there's no edge in it. A warning made of silk. She tilts her head, just slightly, so your fingers brush her neck. 'Joppa needs these by morning. Guldur's recall has to reach Khuzduk Hills before\u2014'\n\nShe doesn't finish, because you've leaned down and your breath is against her ear, and the political calculus she was constructing has become suddenly, beautifully irrelevant.\n\nThe quill drops. Ink pools on parchment.\n\nShe turns in the alcove, one hand rising to the front of your shirt, and the look she gives you is the one you've carried across eight years and three worlds \u2014 dark eyes, half-lidded, a smile that promises everything and concedes nothing.\n\n'The letters,' she murmurs, pulling you closer by the fabric.\n\n'Will wait,' you could say. Or you could let your hands answer for you. Or you could step back \u2014 let the tension hold, unbroken, and watch what she does with it.",
