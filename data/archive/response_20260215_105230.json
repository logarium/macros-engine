Counter-sequence mapping advances \u2014 she isolates the tertiary binding layer where soul-anchors intersect ward geometry. Progress narrowing but incomplete. Needs one more data point from the deep halls.\n\n2. FATHER LALHOLM (Khuzdukan): Catalogues rune-chain candidates from his communion vision. Cross-references with Lithoe's tertiary layer findings. Identifies two candidate chains \u2014 one structural, one parasitic. Cannot determine which holds the wardens' souls without physical inspection of the ward-chamber inscriptions.\n\n3. THORDAK IRONBROW (Khuzdukan): Reports to Kelda at aqueduct: tremor frequency unchanged since last report. Maintains ward-chamber perimeter. Rotates warden shifts. Tends Grull and Torvash \u2014 no change in soul-suspension state.\n\n4. CASTELLAN CONORTH (Caras): Receives Ironmask agent Deryth for third meeting. Deryth shifts approach \u2014 hints at 'allies beyond the mountains who value strong leadership.' Conorth listens, offers nothing, but does not refuse the meeting. Gate inspections continue. Vael evidence courier now one day out.\n\n5. CASTELLAN JOPPA (Vornost): Sealed letter reaches Fort Seawatch \u2014 but Thoron has already departed. Seawatch harbour master holds letter. Joppa continues Dragon Throne preparations. Honour guard drilling daily.\n\n6. TIRRIS VARGOL (Whiteagle Keep): Receives Deryth's latest dispatch via Golden Hind caravan route. Assessment updated: 'Conorth receptive but cautious. Third meeting secured. Recommend continued patience \u2014 he will not move until he sees advantage.' Vargol adjusts timeline. Awaits next report.\n\n7. HARREN VAEL (Riverwatch): Evidence courier departs Riverwatch at dawn, bearing sealed documents toward Caras. Vael watches from the customs house window. The documents detail Golden Hind customs stamp irregularities across three port cities. Courier expected in Caras within two days.",

Begins transcribing ward-chamber inscriptions at the parasitic rune-chain candidate site. Work is slow \u2014 the corridors shake intermittently. She works by staff-light, alone, methodical.\n\n2. FATHER LALHOLM (Khuzdukan): Prepares theological framework for soul-extraction procedure based on Haadis jurisdictional principles. If the rune-chains can be severed, the souls need somewhere to go. Lalholm reasons Haadis can claim them \u2014 but only if the entity's grip is broken first. Drafts a ritual outline. Untested.\n\n3. MERROW KEST (Seawatch): The Torlec ghost vessel in harbour has now been anchored eight days. No movement. No contact. Kest dispatches a harbour boat for visual inspection at dawn \u2014 crew reports deck empty, rigging secure, hull sound. No name plate visible. Kest orders continued observation and sends word to Joppa.\n\n4. CAPTAIN RENDAL (Grey Plains): Intercepts bandit scouts two leagues south of Caras road. Brief skirmish \u2014 bandits flee east. Rendal notes improved coordination: scouts used signal mirrors. Reports to garrison at Caras gate.\n\n5. CONORTH (Caras): Receives Rendal's bandit report. Deploys additional mounted patrol to Caras southern approach. Tightens evening curfew by one hour. Does not connect bandit coordination to any larger pattern.",
