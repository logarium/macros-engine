The stone is slick with moss and the air thickens with each step \u2014 warm, wet, tasting of rot and growing things. Above, Vornost's black walls shrink against a pale sky.\n\nThe swamp opens before you like a wound. Reed beds stretch in every direction, broken by stands of corpse-willow whose trailing branches drag the surface of water that reflects nothing. Somewhere deep in the rushes, birds call \u2014 harsh, repeating notes that sound almost like speech.\n\nValania wraps a cloth across her nose. 'Charming,' she says, scanning the tree line. Her hand rests on her belt knife. She knows this place \u2014 the back door, the way things come and go that Vornost pretends not to notice.\n\nThe path is a suggestion at best. Tussocks of marsh grass offer uncertain footing between stretches of black water. Yellow mist clings to the hollows, and the air sighs through the reeds with a sound that gives the swamps their name \u2014 a long, low exhalation, as if the land itself is breathing.\n\nSpring has not been kind here. The water runs high, the paths half-drowned. Somewhere ahead, the broken causeway leads deeper toward hobgoblin territory. Behind you, the low stairs and Vornost's shadow.\n\nYou are between worlds down here. Between the fortress and the wild. Between what you were and what you must become.",
