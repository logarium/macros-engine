Kael Dravorn, who has been standing at the window like a blade waiting for a sheath, turns his head slightly but does not speak.\n\nIt's Valania who answers.\n\n'You hatched her from the egg,' she says. 'You fed her from your palm. You flew together over the burning fields when the Lords of Fire came. She carried you into battle against things that would unmake the world.' Valania steps away from the doorframe. 'And then Salem closed the gate with you on the wrong side, and you vanished for eight years. She waited. Dragons wait differently than we do \u2014 for them, waiting is rage held in amber.'\n\nShe crosses to the window where Dravorn stands and looks out at the upper tower \u2014 the old roost, empty now, scored with claw marks no mason has dared repair.\n\n'Trust?' She turns back to you. 'She's a dragon. Trust isn't the word. She'll know you. She'll smell the bond on you \u2014 Crandurth, your blood, the old compact. Whether she forgives what happened...' Valania shrugs, a gesture elegant and brutal at once. 'That depends on whether she decides you left her, or were taken from her. And that's a conversation you'll have with her, not with us.'\n\nJoppa clears his throat. 'If it helps \u2014 when she roosts here, she roosts on your tower. Not the garrison tower. Not the gate. Yours. Make of that what you will.'",
