Vornost looms above, its shadow falling across the black water. The low stairs connect the swamps to the fortress — the entrance you use when you don't want to be seen. Marsh gas ignites without warning. Bone-reed thickets grow from old battlefields; disturbing them wakes restless spirits. Sinking ground swallows the unwary. Fever-mist rolls in yellow and stinking, and the voices in it aren't the wind. A corpse-willow grove hangs with what looks like rags until you look closer — bodies, old, Vornost garrison tabards rotted through. Deserters or traitors. Message without words. The Sighing Swamps are Gammaria's back door, and everything that comes through them is either desperate or dangerous."

Vornost looms above, its shadow falling across the black water. The low stairs connect the swamps to the fortress — the entrance you use when you don't want to be seen. Marsh gas ignites without warning. Bone-reed thickets grow from old battlefields; disturbing them wakes restless spirits. Sinking ground swallows the unwary. Fever-mist rolls in yellow and stinking, and the voices in it aren't the wind. A corpse-willow grove hangs with what looks like rags until you look closer — bodies, old, Vornost garrison tabards rotted through. Deserters or traitors. Message without words. The Sighing Swamps are Gammaria's back door, and everything that comes through them is either desperate or dangerous."

          "npc:Valania Lorethor": "SUMMARY: Half-elf assassin. Thoron's great love. Spymistress of Gammaria. The woman who built a king and knows exactly what he's made of.\n\nAPPEARANCE: Long dark hair, dark eyes, beautiful, shapely. Carries Gardurth, sister-sword to Thoron's Crandurth. Wears revealing leather armour — this is not vanity but professional practice; people look where she wants them to look. The Ace of Spades on her armband marked her as an assassin when Morgil first met her; she has never bothered to hide what she is from those sharp enough to read the signs.\n\nVOICE & MANNER: Cunning, vivacious, mischievous. Valania is the most socially intelligent person in any room she enters. She reads people the way Lithoe reads spellbooks — with total absorption and absolute retention. Her humour is dry, warm, and slightly dangerous. She teases Thoron with the confidence of a woman who knows she is loved and does not need to prove it. With others she is charming, attentive, and precisely calibrated — she gives each person exactly the version of herself that will be most useful. This is not deception in the way Thoron deceived Merokan. It is craft. Valania believes unity is strength, and she shapes unity through understanding.\n\nShe is Lawful Evil — not in the sense of cruelty, but in the sense of absolute commitment to a structure she has chosen. That structure is Thoron's kingdom and Thoron's cause. Within that structure she will do anything. Outside it she has no loyalties at all.\n\nORIGIN — DYRN ETH MAL: Valania was born in Dyrn eth Mal on Xanthia, the City of the Wise. Her mother was Alda Suza, a prostitute who worked the seedy Old Temple district. Her father was Vallas Lorethor, an elven trader. Vallas and Alda had a series of encounters over one summer — Valania was the result.\n\n[...truncated]",
          "faction:Nation of Gammaria": "Type: Emerging border state. Militarised survival polity. Founded by Thoron and companions.\nHistory: First durable human realm in region. Expanding outward from Caras and Vornost. Actively contesting hostile wilderness. Founded 14501 AS. Census 14502: Military 1,574, Tallaki 1,433, Settler 4,017, Total 7,024 (excluding PCs).\nCurrent state: Active, responsive. Joppa tracking Thoron east; Conorth tightening Caras gates; Bale crisis at Vanguard; patrols active.\nStructure: Helkar (King = Thoron), Tirris (High Council member = Vargol), Castellan (oversees location = Joppa at Vornost, Conorth at Caras, Bale at Fort Vanguard, Merrow Kest at Seawatch, Harren Vael at Riverwatch).",
          "npc:Suzanne of Corlaine": "SUMMARY: Anti-Paladin of Orcus. Frontier warrior. The wild heart of the party. A girl who wanted to be a knight. A woman whose parents sold her soul before she was old enough to understand.\n\nAPPEARANCE: Short dark hair, blue eyes, powerful, muscular. Carries Yor-Kazh the Unholy Reaver, an immense war-sword. There is nothing subtle about Suzanne. She is built for violence and she looks it. Her beauty is the beauty of a storm — compelling, dangerous, and indifferent to your comfort.\n\nVOICE & MANNER: Sensual and emotional. Violent. Direct to the point of brutality. Suzanne says what she thinks, hits what angers her, and wants what she wants without apology. \"The strong rule, the weak serve\" — this is not philosophy for her, it is survival doctrine. She nearly came to blows with Drauglos in a bar in Nega the night they met, and by the next morning she was following him into the wilderness. That is Suzanne in miniature: confrontation as courtship, violence as intimacy, defiance as the only form of trust she knows.\n\nShe is Chaotic Evil — but this does not mean she is without loyalty or love. It means she recognises no authority except strength and no bond except those she chooses. She chose Thoron. She chose Gammaria. She chose the frontier. Everything else — Orcus included — is obligation imposed on her, not devotion freely given.\n\nORIGIN — CORLAINE: Suzanne is from Corlaine, a beautiful region of forests, hills, valleys, and rivers on the island of Parandia near the continent of Gorramythnm. Corlaine is known for its gorgeous views and wonderful wildlife. And its demon worship.\n\n[...truncated]",
          "npc:Father Lalholm": "SUMMARY: Reaver of Haadis. Death-priest. The bedrock of the party. A boy who was beaten until he died, who met a god on a beach of black sand, and who has spent every day since trying to return to that shore.\n\nAPPEARANCE: Short brown hair, dark eyes. Grim. Moody. Carries a studded black mace. There is nothing inviting about Lalholm's appearance. He looks like what he is — a man who has made death his profession and his devotion. His eyes are patient and watchful and miss very little.\n\nVOICE & MANNER: Domineering. Nihilistic. Devout. Lalholm speaks with the careful precision of a man who believes every word matters because every soul matters. He does not waste language. When he offers counsel, it is considered and deliberate. When he disagrees, he is direct but controlled. He has been right three times when others doubted him — Suzanne has acknowledged this (\"three times right, Lalholm\") — and this gives his advice a weight that even people who distrust him cannot entirely dismiss.\n\nHe is Neutral Evil — his morality is entirely subordinate to his faith. Haadis is all. Every other god is to be opposed. Every soul is to be sent to Haadis with proper blessing at the moment of death. This is not cruelty — it is cosmic housekeeping, from Lalholm's perspective. Souls belong to Haadis. His job is to ensure they arrive.\n\nHis authority response is to dominate. His risk posture is confrontational. But these are tempered by genuine loyalty to Thoron, which he expresses through counsel, through presence, through the steady, unglamorous work of being the person who stays when everything is falling apart. He is the bedrock. He does not crack.\n\n[...truncated]",
          "faction:Church of Haadis": "Type: Global, entrenched. Malevolent, patient, doctrinally absolute. Ancient religion elevated to transnational church. Ruled by Jezrath Hallowsbane in Ellethea - High Reavers have regional control.\nHistory: Transnational legitimacy-competitor. Unofficially invested in Gammaria through Father Lalholm. Tests moral/jurisdictional boundaries. Officially neutral; slow infiltration; long-horizon pressure. The Church's true concerns are theological - send souls to Haadis by whatever means possible.\nCanonical truth (restricted): Haadis desires to devour souls sent by his Reavers.\nCurrent state: Active. Testing boundaries. Lalholm's departure from Riverwatch may delay or accelerate jurisdictional push.\nKey NPC: Father Lalholm (companion, with Thoron). The Church's investment is through him whether he likes it or not.",
          "npc:Lithoe Wano-Kan": "SUMMARY: Wizard. Lore keeper. The party's most powerful spellcaster and its loneliest soul. A woman who spoke one word of a dead god's language and blinded herself for six months. Still hungry for more.\n\nAPPEARANCE: Medium blonde hair, blue eyes, thin, focused. Carries a gnarled Staff of Power. Lithoe looks like what she is — a person consumed by study. There is an intensity to her focus that is both impressive and slightly unnerving. She does not relax easily. Even in casual moments she has the air of someone whose mind is elsewhere, running calculations, tracing patterns, solving problems no one else has noticed.\n\nVOICE & MANNER: Selfish, reserved, lonely. Lithoe speaks precisely when she speaks at all, and often doesn't. She is not rude so much as absent — the world of people and their needs often fails to register against the far more interesting world of arcane theory. When she does engage socially, it tends to be transactional: she needs something, or she has information to share, or someone has intruded on her attention and she needs to deal with them before returning to what matters.\n\nShe is Neutral Evil — not through malice but through indifference. Other people's concerns simply do not weigh against her own needs unless she has specifically chosen to care about them. The people she has chosen to care about are a very short list: Guldur, Valania, and to a diminishing degree, the party as a collective entity that provides her protection.\n\nHer authority response is to appease. Her risk posture is self-preservation. She does not fight for dominance — she avoids conflict until it becomes unavoidable, then deploys devastating force.\n\n[...truncated]",
          "npc:Guldur Emeldyr": "SUMMARY: Fighter. Friend. The human heart of an inhuman party. A lazy rich boy who lost everything to a plague and accidentally became the most decent person in a band of killers.\n\nAPPEARANCE: Short sandy hair, blue eyes, handsome, cheerful. Carries a bottle of cheap wine. That last detail is the most important one. In a party of legendary warriors, assassins, death-priests, and demon-bound anti-paladins, Guldur carries a bottle of cheap wine. He is the human-scale character, and he knows it, and he has made it his identity.\n\nVOICE & MANNER: Dry sense of humour. Nimble physically and mentally. Sarcastic. Guldur's primary motivation is — and this is canonical — \"always have a killer joke, pun, or quip ready for the occasion.\" This is not comic relief. This is survival strategy. When you travel with people who can level buildings and command dragons, the safest thing to be is the one who makes them laugh. Nobody kills the funny one.\n\nBut underneath the wit is something more serious. Guldur's authority response is to insult — he deflects tension with mockery, redirects aggression with humour, and uses sarcasm as a diagnostic tool. If he's joking about something, he's noticed it. If he stops joking, it's serious. His role in the party is joker and foil, but the seed document also says he \"makes the hard calls.\" That combination — the man who laughs at everything and then, when it matters, speaks the truth nobody else will — is what makes him essential.\n\nHe is Chaotic Neutral. He will not harm innocents. This is his moral limit, and in a party where the alignment tendencies are Chaotic Evil, Lawful Evil, Neutral Evil, and Neutral Evil, it makes him the closest thing to a conscience the group has.\n\n[...truncated]",

Marsh gas ignites without warning. Bone-reed thickets grow from old battlefields; disturbing them wakes restless spirits. Sinking ground swallows the unwary. Fever-mist rolls in yellow and stinking, and the voices in it aren't the wind. A corpse-willow grove hangs with what looks like rags until you look closer — bodies, old, Vornost garrison tabards rotted through. Deserters or traitors. Message without words.

The woman who built a king and knows exactly what he's made of.\n\nAPPEARANCE: Long dark hair, dark eyes, beautiful, shapely. Carries Gardurth, sister-sword to Thoron's Crandurth. Wears revealing leather armour — this is not vanity but professional practice; people look where she wants them to look. The Ace of Spades on her armband marked her as an assassin when Morgil first met her; she has never bothered to hide what she is from those sharp enough to read the signs.\n\nVOICE & MANNER: Cunning, vivacious, mischievous.

That structure is Thoron's kingdom and Thoron's cause. Within that structure she will do anything. Outside it she has no loyalties at all.\n\nORIGIN — DYRN ETH MAL: Valania was born in Dyrn eth Mal on Xanthia, the City of the Wise. Her mother was Alda Suza, a prostitute who worked the seedy Old Temple district. Her father was Vallas Lorethor, an elven trader. Vallas and Alda had a series of encounters over one summer — Valania was the result.\n\nShe grew up in poverty, surrounded by pimps, prostitutes, thugs, and johns. And as a half-elf, her childhood lasted far longer than any human's. Her human half-sister Elendia grew to adulthood and beyond. Alda died of old age. Valania was still maturing. But during that extended childhood she learned twice as much as any human could. By thirty, she already knew half a dozen ways to kill a man.\n\nThis is the foundation of everything Valania is. She didn't learn to read people in an academy or a court. She learned it in the Old Temple district, watching her mother's clients, reading the difference between the ones who would pay and leave and the ones who would hurt someone. She learned what men want, what they'll do to get it, and how to position yourself so that their wanting serves your purposes instead of theirs. The vivacious charm, the precise calibration, the ability to give each person exactly the version of herself they need — all of it was survival skill before it was tradecraft.\n\nTHE BANNERS: It was only natural that the Banners — Dyrn eth Mal's shadowy rogues' guild — would take her in as one of their own. Valania rose through the ranks, turning natural aptitudes and learned skills to the task of murder with startling efficiency. Years spent maturing in the underbelly of the City of the Wise had honed her mind. She went from fresh recruit to senior assassin in three years. The Ace of Spades was her calling card.\n[...truncated]"
